# fantasypunk

Let’s get playing this game.

**fantasypunk** is a game of made-up stories and heroic fantasy. Everyone playing pretends they are someone else in someplace else, somewhere filled with magic, fantastic beings and otherworldly horizons. Some people create problems and some people solve those problems, and many times, both are the same people. Hopefully, everyone playing will be right in the thick of it.

As you play, you take part in a conversation.

Conversations vary in so many ways. People talk and listen, sometimes one after the other and other times everyone at the same time, and sometimes nobody feels like they have something to say.

What is important is that a conversation makes sense when everyone taking part in it is having a good time and is feeling welcome, heard and boundaries are cared for.

Just like in a regular conversation, there are many questions to ask. In this conversation, though, the answers depend a little on what you know and a lot on what you can come up with on the spot.

But this game has a lot of things to help you have ideas because coming up with stuff on the spot is hard if you have to do a lot of it for a long time.

That’s why this game has a bunch of text divided into instructions, rules, prompts and guidance.

# Preparations

We need things, time and people to play **fantasypunk.** We also need to establish expectations and boundaries.

The ideal number of players ranges from 3 to 6. It doesn’t matter if you are playing over an online call or in-person for that. It’s possible for only 2 people to play, as well as more than 6 people, although I don’t recommend a very large group playing all at once.

A single, solo player could play too. But you will need to make a few accommodations as this game does not include guidance for solo play yet.

One of the players will play as the Giramundo, or GM, while the remaining players take the roles of Party Members. When the game refers to the Party, Party Members or Characters, we are talking about everyone who’s not the GM.

The necessary materials include writing and recording implements to keep the character sheets and adventure notes, and some six-sided dice, which we call d6 in this game. You can use physical or digital materials, in any combination.

Then we need time. Two to four hours is a reasonable amount of playtime, with plenty of breaks and snacks. It’s quite possible to play longer sessions, especially if the group is larger, or shorter sessions, especially if the group is smaller.

Finally, we need to set expectations for the game and to set boundaries for safe, accessible and welcoming play.

There is a whole chapter in **fantasypunk** that covers safety tools, at least superficially. But it includes links for you to make further research on your own.

> 📍 Safety is a group responsibility and shouldn’t fall upon the shoulders of any individual player alone. 
It may be that the player hosting the game takes it upon themselves to have more responsibilities than the others, but that doesn’t mean they are supposed to do it all by themselves.

**In a shortlist you need:**

- a player to be the GM and others to play the Party;
- writing and recording implements, physical or digital, to keep the character sheets and play notes;
- some six-sided dice, hopefully, a bunch of them per player, but in a pinch, only one will do;
- about two to four hours to play, maybe more, maybe less depending on group size;
- a choice of safety tools to be discussed among the players in the group.

# Pillars, Agenda and Principles

These are the first guidelines to help you play the game as it was intended. Stick close to them if you are a beginner and you will be fine.

Whether you’ve never played a role-playing game before or you have played many, look at this section to understand what sort of worlds and adventures you can hope to have at first.

When you’re not sure what to do, or you run out of ideas, come back here to help you figure out what to do next.

Keep in mind that these guidelines are assumptions, and expectations, not hard, unbreakable rules. The more you play, the easier it gets to play with or around them.

The GM has a specific set of principles and agenda that differ a little from this, but we will get there.

## The Pillars of Play

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around the party;
- Folk are complicated, conflicted and diverse, but are mostly kind and willing to help;
- The Party is fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- The gods are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals;
- No individuals, folk or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being.

## Agenda

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## Principles

- Be brave and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions. Always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

# Playing the Game

The game effectively begins with the group deciding about the kind of adventure all of you want to have, and what safety tools the group is most comfortable with.

The next step is creating a Party, which involves answering a few questions, as a group and individually.

Then creating the individual player characters, or Party Members, which is a simple process composed of a few steps.

Once everyone is ready, create the starting point of the adventure. All players, Party and GM, get to have a say here. If the group is feeling adventurous, then pick the Themes and Domains at random by rolling dice.

> 🎲 Create a location by choosing 2 Themes and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain. Name the location.

> 📍 You can use a different procedure or an altogether different game to create a new location. There are a ton of great games such as [I’m sorry did you say street magic](https://seaexcursion.itch.io/street-magic), [Wanderhome](https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/wanderhome), [Awen](https://levikornelsen.itch.io/awen), [Premise](https://randylubin.itch.io/premise-setting-character-plot), some [Alone Hacks](https://itch.io/c/1059591/azukails-alone-among-the-stars-hacks), and so on.

# Party Concepts

> *Your party is your family, at least sorts of. You only hang out with these people because you want to and because it makes sense. You have come to rely on each other, even if uneasily.
Best of all, among yourselves, you all know you can be you, and that's something you can hardly find anywhere else.*
> 

Choosing a party concept does two things: it helps the group decide together what kind of adventures everyone is going for, and it connects the party members to the world through questions and prompts.

You don’t have to commit to any of the options below forever, or you don’t have to commit to them at all, creating your own party concepts instead.

<aside>
📖 Choose a party concept from the options below. This choice is not forever, after all, if you make enough of a mess, you might have to skip town. Or you might just help overthrow the local governing bodies or something of the like. Feel free to come up with your own.

</aside>

## Buffer

You are the defenders or protectors of the local folk. Someone figured that if something bad came, it better come for you first.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Buffer if you want to stick to a small region, such as a town, city or whatever form of social organisation that makes sense in the setting.

</aside>

- Who or what makes this job worth it so that you just don't bail without looking back?
- Whose privilege you're shielding with your own lives?
- Why is that threat exaggerated, misleading or flat unreal?

## Misfits

Even if you wanted to settle down, finding peace anywhere folk wouldn't just keep bothering you or giving weird looks is a challenge in itself.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Misfits if you want to travel around at ease and on your terms, focusing on the journey and exploration.

</aside>

- Why does banding together seem to be the least bad alternative?
- What do you tell yourselves as a reason why you bounce around the world and why is it only partially true?
- Why can't you go home, and why is that only partially true?

## Vagabonds

You did something terrible and you must stay on the road. Well, at least that's what people say about you.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Vagabons if you wish to interact with people and organisations and you want to feel bounce between local intrigue and perilous journey.

</aside>

- Why do you have a bad reputation, and how is it only partially untrue?
- Whose position do you threaten by being you?
- Whose imposition force you to be on the run?

# Creating a Character

Now is the time you will conceptualize what kind of adventurer you want to play. All you need to do is follow the instructions below and you will have a character ready to go in no time.

When you’re done, introduce your characters to each other, and ask each as many questions as you want about each other’s characters. The GM might have some specific questions too. Either way, give honest and forthcoming answers. 

It’s ok to not have a good answer or any answer at all too. You will learn more about your characters as you play.

## Identity

> *I never forget a name or a face. If I catch your name and your likeness, it’s forever. That is a really good thing to have going when there’s a lot of people that owe me money.*
> 

Every fantasy character has a cool, mysterious name and an even cooler presence.

Your name can be inspired by your favourite characters or personalities out there, or you can pick some random name generator, you can pick an interesting word such as Crow or Mischievous.

Your presence is a basic description of your character, including looks, poise, or some other features.

Do what you want as long as you don't write anything racist, ableist or otherwise bigoted.

📖 Come up with a name, pronouns and a brief description of your character's presence.
Tip: try using emotions or personality features, or avoiding colour words for aesthetics.

## Origins

> *So you are an adventurer? And what life did you lose before you were born into this one?*
> 

When fleshing out the world around you, your Origins will help the GM come up with the right questions or answers for your character.

📖 Roll or choose your Origins on the table below, then write a short description of what it means.

| Roll | Woe | Status | Occupation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Exiled | Rebellious | Soldier |
| 2 | Runaway | Guild | Socialite |
| 3 | Ruined | Official | Artist |
| 4 | Lost | Court | Researcher |
| 5 | Wanted | Community | Aide |
| 6 | Infamous | Lead | Mage |

🎲 **Knack**

Spend 1 Hold to ask the GM a question about what your character should know or should be able to do based on your Background.

## Heritage Tags

> *All people are unique, see? There's the one who sees in the dark like a cat and the other with a tail like a monkey's. And then there's Jenna. It's pretty handy to go into the dark forgotten places of the world with someone who glows like a candle.*
> 

Heritage Tags allow you to do things most others can't, such as seeing in the dark, climbing a wall with your bare hands or gliding through the air with vestigial wings. 

Heritage Tags are noticeable by others.

📖 Roll or choose 2 Heritage Tags on the table below. Alternatively, you can come up with your own.

1. Infravision Sight
2. Badger Claws
3. Strength of Two
4. Stone Skin
5. Luminous Aura
6. Translucent Body

🎲 **Boon and Bane**

Once per session, you can use a Boon and a Bane.

**Boon**: Turn a 5 or below into a 6. Describe which Tag helps you succeed.

**Bane**: Turn a 4 or higher into a 3. Describe which Tag is hindering you and clear and recover 1 Hold.

## Traits

> *It's all about the right approach, you see? There are plenty of times to be nice and kind, and plenty of other times when you gotta kick the doors open.*
> 

As you navigate the world, you engage its peoples, its problems and its solutions through five traits:

- **Kind**: when you approach the world gently and with understanding;
- **Brave**: when you approach the world with courage and boldness;
- **Curious**: when you approach the world by observing and learning;
- **Precise**: When you approach the world with mastery and knowledge;
- **Insightful**: when you approach the world through its subtle veils.

📖 Choose a trait to Highlight and a trait to Suppress.

🎲 A **Highlighted Trait** adds 2d6 to your dice pool. A **Suppressed Trait** adds none. The others add 1d6.

🎲 **Rolling dice**: take all of the dice provided by your Traits, Baggage or other things and roll them all at once. Keep the two highest dice and add them together.
Critical Hit: if the result is a 12, it’s a critical hit;
Solid Hit: if the result is 10 or above, it’s a solid hit;
Messy Hit: if the result is 7, 8 or 9, it’s a messy hit;
Miss: if the result is 6 or below, it’s a miss.

## Baggage

> *I thought that wand of yours was just for show. Good thing those goons thought so too.*

Baggage represents the relevant things you carry with you, material and otherwise, such as your Principles, a Sword, or Cunning.

As you adventure and face challenges, you may take harm from a battle, be frustrated by an obstacle or feel lost, weakened and beat up by many adversities, causing you to lose Hold of these very things you've come to rely on.

📖 Write down 5 things to create your Baggage: something that you wield, wear, seek, fear and hide. Give each item 3 Hold.

🎲 When you make a roll, you may choose an item from your Baggage to rely on.

Add one die to the pool per Hold, then cross 1 Hold, unless you roll a critical hit.

Erase an item from your baggage to recover 3 Hold to the other items.

When you cross out all Aspects across all of your Baggage, you become Crushed.

When you erase all items from your Baggage, you become Unburdened.

## Bonds & Debts

> *Ach! Fine! But if I help you this time, you better come at the drop of a hat when I need you, you hear me?*
> 

📖 Create a Bond with an NPC and a Debt with another, then create a Bond with the player to your left (when in person) or below your name (when online).

🎲 To track down Bonds and Debts, write down the name of the character the new connection is with and a sentence describing the bond or debt. 
Deepening a bond or a debt adds another sentence to it, and paying off either asks the player to erase a sentence.

## **Moves**

> *I wish I could swing a sword like you. People give you a wide berth when they realise you have no idea what you’re doing.*
> 

Moves are special ways to engage the fiction. Most of them require rolling dice, paying a price, or both. To make a move, just make a move. And when you make a move, you make the move.

Essentially, there are two types of Moves: Basic Moves, which are available to all players, and Special Moves, which each player chooses from the options available to refine their characters.

📖 Choose 3 Special Moves.
