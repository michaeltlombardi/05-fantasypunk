# fantasypunk quickstart

> *There is a crack in everything. That is how the light gets in.* - Leonard Cohen
>
>Heroes are often thought of as paragons of strength, wisdom, or virtue who always seem to figure out what to do, or always get the specific help they need when they get stuck. They seem to never face hopelessness or loss for too long, or only for long enough to turn those into yet another form of power.
>
>So they stride across the land, stomping over every challenge in their path, destroying everything that opposes them, and disregarding all folk, magic, or nature that happen to be in their way.
>
>The tales told here are not about them.
>
>The tales told here are about much more fallible people. Complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people. The people who create problems and who solve problems, and how often both are the same people.
>
>No one can guarantee that the rough-edged and jaded stories told here won't be, in time, worn down by the tongues of storytellers into shapes perfectly smooth, rounded, and solid.
>
>But until then, let's look at what burdens that complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people accumulate, and how they crack under their weight.

# What is fantasypunk?

**fantasypunk** is a game of incredible and fallible characters, the way they approach the world around them, and the baggage they carry.

Together we will weave tales of wanderers, travellers, the found and the lost, the seekers and the runaways, the people they meet, the friends they make along the way, and the communities they are part of or drop from.

If you want to play a hypercapitalist murder-pillage power fantasy, this is not the game for you; please refer to that racist dragon game of colonization owned by white billionaires.

If you choose to be a bigot, a racist, a fascist, a nazi, make yourself a favour and crawl back into the slimy pit your crawled out from.

After all, the real, true monsters are those who choose to be monsters.

# 1 - Playing the Game

This is a short summary of how to start playing **fantasypunk**.

## It's dangerous out there: take these

- a player to be the Giramundo, or GM, a kind of host and guide for the game;
- a group of 3 to 5 players to be the Party Companions, or PCs. You can stray from that range, but I can't promise it will work as well;
- at least one six-sided die (d6), although at 5 or 6 of them is better;
- writing materials, analog or digital, whatever;
- and the basic rules for this game as a reference
- about 3 or 4 hours to play together: have breaks when necessary;
- a safe, welcoming, comfortable environment to play, phisically or online;
- an agreement on safty tools, tone and and expectations for each session you play.

## Prepare

1. Take turns reading the Pillars of Play;
2. Choose an existing scenario or setting, create your own together, or roll 1d6 on the table below:
 
    |1d6|Thread|
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Sol |
    | 2 | Many Moons |
    | 3 | We, The Monsters |
    | 4 | Everything is Good |
    | 5 | Stonetouched |
    | 6 | A Rock and a Hard Place |

3. Create a PC for each player;

## Play

4. The GM opens a scene by throwing the PCs into a tricky, dangerous, or otherwise charged situation by describing the place and people the PCs are met with;
5. The players tell the GM what they want to do, and if that is an opportunity to make a Move, make that Move;
6. The GM responds with their own Moves, prompting the players, or prompring the players to move on to the next scene;
7. Repeat steps 4-7 until the time for play is up or everyone agrees the session should end;

## End of the Session

8. when you end the session, decide whether you wish to continue this Tale, or move on to another Tale or another game.

# 2 - The Pillars of Play

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around you;
- People are complicated, diverse, and often conflicted but are mostly kind and willing to do good;
- Most people, including you, are fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- Deities are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals whether they exist at all;
- No individuals, communities or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency.

## Agenda

The agenda is a set of overarching goals intended to guide you in play.

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## Principles

These principles will help you put everyone in the same page.

- Be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions, always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

# 3 - Scenarios and Settings

Settings and scenarios are the background of the tale you are all sharing.

As long as there is magic and wonder, and many opportunities to meet interesting people and get into and out of trouble, any world works.

And if you are stuck, here's a little list of starting scenarios for your game. Just pick one everyone goes wide-eyed for or roll 1d6, or maybe combine them somehow.

1. **Sol** - The world is incredibly old, and civilizations rose and fell so many times few dare keep track. The Old World left Relics powered by the Sun, which no one can recreate and few can figure out what they are for, often settling on repurposing them. Sol is a Post-Fantasy setting of high magic and mystical technology both ubiquitous and mysterious;

2. **Many Moons** - It is said that less than a century ago, the Last Day set, the sky lit up with crimson and gold, the stars burned and then many Moons rose from the core of the planet to light the path to freedom. They criss-cross the sky, bathing us with eternal twilight, ever-shifting the Tides, which we learned to Sail to build our lives within the crystal domes that now bejewel the world.

3. **We, the Monsters** - When the Spheres converged, Humans poured into our world, hell-bent on conquering, colonizing, and annihilating everything they didn't own or understand. They call our homes lairs, our communities hordes, and us they call monsters. They have destroyed or stolen too much, yet it is not enough. But we, the Monsters, will hold our ground and push back, and they will be sorry they ever set foot in our world.

4. **Everything is Good** - There is a village between the River and the Mountain, embraced by the Woods. In this quiet, peaceful village, the Elders keep the Community organized, while the folk toil and idle happily. Every day is the same, everyone is content and everything is in place. And it's all wrong. All of you are blow-ins, but none of you remember where you arrived from, who you were before or why you are here. And this realization hits you like a hammer as all of you wake up somewhere deep in the woods, by a white obelisk, and there are a bunch of dead people lying around you.

5. **Stonetouched** - When the children of Lua come of age, they gather around the Stones, a set of rocks that sprout from the ground in a semi-circular formation. They sing and dance, and the stones hum in harmony with their chant. During the ritual, each youth vibes with one of the Stones, receiving one of the aspects of the moonfolk: 
    - From the Black Stone, the form of the Moon, Enluara. 
    - From the Myriad stone, the form of the Dream, Quimera. 
    - From the Coral Stone,the form of the Fire, Valente. 
    - From the Nightstone, the form of the Star, Celeste. 
    - From the Clearstone, the form of the Light, Lumiar. 
    
    Usually, three to five youths participate in the ceremony together. Once they receive their blessings, they are to be sent out in the world as a party and journey through it to become wiser.

6. **A Rock and a Hard Place** - A Runaway Princess, a Stargazer, a Knight of the Moon and Star, and a Petty Criminal find themselves beset by a band of mercenaries led by The Hound on one flank, while the gates of the Devil's Keep looms on the other. This day started badly when you lost the ship to sail past the Misty Sea towards the Rou homeland, and now this. How did you end up in this situation, and, more importantly, how will you get the heck out of it?

# 4 - The Cast

The Party Companions in **fantasypunk** are magical and mundane at the same time.

## Gather Your Party & Venture Forth

The party is a home away from home. A kind of found family that tags along for better or for worse, by choice or out of need, all cozy and nice or bickering endlessly.

To create a Party Companion, each player must follow the steps below, not necessarily in the order presented.

It's strongly encouraged that all of you create your PCs together to bounce ideas off of each other.

1. Start with a name and pronouns
2. Each character has 5 Traits: Kind, Brave, Curious, Careful, and Insightful. Tag one of those as Striving, and another as Struggling.
3. Pick a Background;
4. Take 5 Burdens: your background offers a few Burdens and a few prompts to create the rest;
5. Choose 2 Special Moves to complete your character;
6. Revise your choices and talk about them with the other players. Change anything you need.

# 5 - Roleplaying, Moves and Dice

**fantasypunk** is played as a kind of conversation where everyone is adding something to the tale to take it into fun and interesting directions.

What makes it different from any other conversation is the unique boundaries provided by the pillars, the setting, the principles, and the agenda.

Many times, the GM will propose a situation, offer details or escalate the drama, prompting the PCs to act or react to it.

The GM will respond in kind and so on and so forth.

Sometimes the PCs choose to do something bold, take a risk, raise the stakes, face opposition... or most likely just do something cool to see what happens.

That's when Moves come into play, usually asking the dice what direction the tale should go.

## Making Moves

All you have to do to make a move is read the move and follow its instructions, asking and answering any questions, and interpreting open ended promps.

You can also make some moves just because you want to stir the pot, or just because, whatever you feel like in the moment.

These are the most relevant moves:

- Approach Moves: These moves are based on your traits, Kind, Brave, Curious, Careful and Insightful. Set your intentions, roll the dice and describe what you do;
- Special Moves: Special moves usually require that you be Kind, Brave, Curious, Careful or Insightful. In short, make an Approach Move:

> Make an Approach Move > Roll the dice > On a solid hit, resolve the Approach move > Resolve the Special Move

## The Dice Pool

When a move asks you to roll the dice, it's prompting you to pool together all the dice provided by your Traits, Baggage, situational modifiers, and so on, roll them all, then keep the highest two results, adding them together.

- Start with 1d6 from a Trait ( ), 2d6 from a Striving Trait (+) and no dice from a Struggling Trait (-);
- You get +1d6 from Relying on your Baggage;
- You get +1d6 from a +1 Forward or a +1 Ongoing. Having both won't stack;
- You get +1d6 when you **Start Uneven** (See basic moves).

If you don't get enough dice to roll at least 2d6 when you make a move, you should just consider it a miss.

On the other hand, you can't have a pool bigger than 5d6. Just ignore any dice above that.

## Hits and Misses

See the results and outcomes from rolling a 2d6 dice roll. When in doubt, use the third column to help you interpret the result of a move. 


Result | Outcome | Meaning
---------|----------|---------
 12    | Critical hit | Yes, and
 10-11 | Solid hit | Yes
 7-9 | Messy hit | Yes, but
 1-6 | Miss | Brace Yourself

## The Burden Die

When you roll a Burden Die, keep track of its result, regardless of whether you add it to the final roll or not.

> Tip: use a die of a different colour or size, or always count the first die you roll in the pool as the Burden Die if one is being rolled.

# 6 - Basic Moves

# Approaches

More important than what tools, powers or skills you have, your Traits represent how you approach the world around you.

There is no right or wrong choice of Traits to approach a situation; each Trait prompts certain questions or possibilities, fundamentally asking you, "what is your intention, and how do you act on it?", and then everyone finds out what happens.

## Be Kind

When you are **kind**, choose the one Key that best reflects your intention:

- heal, treat, aid;
- relate, inspire, support;
- sway, disarm, placate.

 Describe how you pursue your intention through your words or deeds, then roll the dice.

- Solid Hit: ask the other PCs and the GM what their character, a place or another entity needs the most.
- Messy Hit: **embrace a shortcoming**.
- Miss: **brace yourself**.

## Be Brave

When you are **brave**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- protect, confront, oppose;
- endure, resist, seize, divert;
- encourage, embolden, empower.

On a Solid Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM how you can stand against wrong or harm, to yourself or to others.

On an Messy Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Curious

When you are **curious**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- observe, study, search;
- meddle, probe, test;
- contact, request, engage.

On a Solid Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM about something you wish to know more about.

On an Messy Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Careful

When you are **careful**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- respect, watch, learn;
- disarm, dissuade, divert;
- prepare, plan, position.

On a Solid Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM about the world around you to find your way forward.

On an Messy Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Insightful

When you are **insightful**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- wonder, portend, imagine;
- sense, probe, trust, appease;
- attune, empower, inspire.

On a Solid Hit,  open your senses to the wondrous and otherworldly, then ask the other PCs and the GM what you find.

On an Messy Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

# Resolution Moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## Embrace a Shortcoming

When you **embrace a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or roll 1d6 to let the dice choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose a Shortcoming before you roll and add 1d6 to the Dice Pool.

1. you make a **mistake**, wether you realize it now or later;
2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## Brace Yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit. 

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## Push Back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **give up** an item from your Baggage.

# Trust Moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## Offer Help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you share the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## Get in the Way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

- If they say yes, **load up**;
- If they say no, they **load up**.

If you give them no choice, **take a Burden**.

# Burdens

Most of us carry our own weight, then some.

## Invoke a Burden

When you **invoke a Burden**, describe how you use it or rely on it, then add a Burden Die to the dice pool. When you roll, compare its result to the Burden's Weight.

**Roll over:** When you roll over its Weight, your Burden weighs down on you a little as you lean on it. **Make it heavier**.

**Roll under:** When you roll under its Weight, **it becomes too heavy to bear**.

## Make Heavier

When you **make a Burden heavier**, increase its Weight by 1.

## Make Lighter

When you **make a Burden lighter**, decrease its Weight by 1.

## The Last Straw

When the last Burden you carry becomes **too heavy to bear**, it's the **last straw**.

**Choose ccceptance**, however uneasily, and let go. Erase one of your burdens and describe how it was lost, broken, given away, how it is inaccessible or something else.

Clear X weight (maybe all?) from all remaining Burdens.

**Refuse to let go**, however regretfully, and retain all Burdens. However, you must choose one:

- **Lash out**: you respond to loss with dispropornate aggression towards someone else.
To clear Angry, hurt someone or break something important.
- To clear Afraid, run from something difficult.
- To clear Guilty, make a sacrifice to absolve your guilt.
- To clear Hopeless, fling yourself into easy relief.
- To clear Insecure, take foolhardy action without talking to your team.
