# Challenges

Sometimes problems require more than a simple, direct approach.

Challenges represent contests, conflict, or complex obstacles that will put the party through the gauntlet.

The prosecutor at a trial, a group of armed soldiers, a troll in the middle of a bridge, children playing tag or a dragon raining fire down on the party are all examples of Challenges.

## Creating a Challenge

1. Determine the nature of the Challenge the party will face.

    Examples:

    - A debate with the High Magistrate;
    - Traversing a room warded by Magic Sigils;
    - Battling a Fiery Dragon.
2. Define what Angles that Challenge has.

    An Angle is a word or short phrase that describes what advantages or actions a Challenge can leverage against the Party.

    The more Angles a Challenge has, the harder it is to overcome it.

    Look at these examples of Challenges. These are not all of the possible types of challenges, only a few more or less obvious situations.

    ðŸ”– **Fiery Dragon.**

    - Fire Breath

    - Steel Scales
    - Ancient Magica
    - Cunning

### **Tags**

    Resistance to mundane attacks

### **Moves**

    - **Survival above all else:** if the dragon becomes certain it's losing the upper hand, it will attempt to break out.
    - **Dragon Fire**: The dragon's fire causes a magical burn that causes otherworldly pain and can only be fully healed with special magic.
