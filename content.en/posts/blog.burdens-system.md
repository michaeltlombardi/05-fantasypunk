# burdens - outline

The outline for the burdens system is like this:

## using burdens

- players rely on burdens
- burdens get heavier;
- if a burden gets too heavy, players can't rely on it anymore;
- if all burdens get too heavy something bigger happens;

## recovering burdens

not quite sure on it, but I thought on this:

- during respite, start a project;
- probably with a clock;
- once the clock is done, get a new burden;

I am not convinced on doing this at all. I feel that the character overall journey encompasses just giving up burdens or holding onto them, and dealing changing with that

## losing all burdens

losing is a kind of charged word but it's a shorthand here

when a character loses all burdens they must have a choice to make:

- retire that character and end their tale - i suppose this could come accompanied by some real cool narrative choice or something;
- start a legacy - the character becomes a supporting character and the players starts a new one informed by the old one somehow
- retire that character and turn them into a supporting character as a sort of ally to the party
- choose a new background

# the issue

the one issue really is that the words are tripping me but otherwise I am confident in this system.
