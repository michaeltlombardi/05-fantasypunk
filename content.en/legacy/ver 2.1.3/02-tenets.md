# 1 - tenets: collaborative common ground

The tenets of **fantasypunk** in Pillars, Agenda and Principles.

## pillars

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around you;
- People are complicated, diverse, and often conflicted but are mostly kind and willing to do good;
- Most people, including you, are fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- Deities are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals whether they exist at all;
- No individuals, communities or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency.

## agenda

The agenda is a set of overarching goals intended to guide you in play.

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## principles

These principles will help you put everyone in the same page.

- Be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions, always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.
