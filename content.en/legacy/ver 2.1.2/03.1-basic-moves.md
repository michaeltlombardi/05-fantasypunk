# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all PCs at all times.

When you make a basic move, you will roll several d6 at once and add the two highest results.

To create a dice pool, add as many dice as the chosen trait provide, +1d6 if you **rely on your baggage**, +1d6 if you **embrace a shortcoming** from the start.

A trait you struggle with (-) adds no dice to the dice pool. A trait you thrive on (+) adds 2d6 to the dice pool. The other traits add 1d6.

You can't roll the dice unless you have at least 2d6 in your dice pool.
