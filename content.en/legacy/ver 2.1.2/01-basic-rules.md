small explanations (for now)

## Roles

To play **fantasypunk**, you want a Group of 4 to 6 players. More or less players than that may work, but it's unlikely that the game will flow as naturally.

There are 2 different roles players can assume: GM and PC.

One player takes the role of Giramundo, GM for short. As the GM you will provoke dramatic situations for the the other players and teach them the rules. Knowing the rules well is great, but learning as you go is will work juts fine.

The remaining players take the role of PCs, or player characters. As a PC you will create a character to roleplay. All of the PCs work together to create an interesting, fun story for your characters (even if your characters are not as inclined to work together).

## Making Moves

When certain situations arise in the story, you pause the conversation to roll dice. This is called making a move. Each move has a different trigger condition.

Basic moves are available to all PCs, while Special Moves and Unique Moves are only available to the PCs who have picked them.

In addition, some moves can only be made during more specific moments of the game, such as when journeying, resting or delving into danger.

### Rolling Dice

Most times when you need to roll, you will make a dice pool.

Your traits, baggage and other features will let you add a number of d6 to the dice pool.

When you have at least 2d6 in your pool, roll all of the dice and keep the highest 2 results, adding them together.

If you have less than 2d6 in your dice pool, maybe you will need to use your Baggage, embrace shortcomings, or otherwise find ways to add enough dice to the pool to be be able to roll at least 2d6.

When you add the highest 2d6 in the dice pool, you will get one of these results:

- Critical Hit: 12
- Sound Hit: 10+
- Messy Hit: 7-9
- Miss: 6-

Not all moves have a specific outcome for a critical hit.

## Creating and Roleplaying a Character

To create a character, grab a character sheet, an index card or some other implement for writing and taking notes, and fill it in by following the character creation procedures.

When roleplaying your character, describe what they would do or say, and when in doubt, you can reference your character sheet to get ideas.

### Background

(from Troika)

Backgrounds are everything your character was before you got hold of them. 

They provide you with Baggage, Unique Traits and a Unique Move. Slide into the role and make it your own.

Rework them or remove them entirely and replace them with your own unique vision of the world. Boldy lay claim to the games you play, create content recklessly, and always write in pen.

### Common Traits

The most basic ways to explore the world. 

Be Kind to yourself and others. Be Brave to do what you want or what you need. Be Curious to allow yourself to be surprised. Be Mindful of what you do or say. Be Insightful to notice the big and small wonders at the edge of the plain.

Choose a trait you struggle to be. It adds no dice to the Dice Pool. Choose another, which you thrive on. It adds 2d6 to your Dice Pool. The remaining traits add 1d6 to the Dice Pool when you make moves with them.

### Baggage

Whether you are a survivor, jaded by hardship, a sheltered, privileged romantic, or a bright-eyed novice seeking adventure, you carry Baggage.

Your Baggage is an abstraction of some of the things you find most important or take for granted. These can be literal objects such as a poetry book or a trusty sword, but they can also be things such as a pool of knowledge you have access to, skills, principles, personal truths and so on.

But baggage is not free; it carries a history, hopes and expectations. And sometimes they get heavy, so much so you may bucle under its Weight.

Every time you **Rely on your Baggage**, add 1 Weight to the specific item you rely on and roll 1d6 for each Weight point you have marked. If you roll a 1, that item becomes a Burden, and you can't rely on it safely for a while.
