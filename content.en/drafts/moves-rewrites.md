## Rewrite Ideas

### Express a Trait

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 1d6 instead.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

**When you are kind**, ask the GM or another player what their character, a place or another entity needs. Ask yourself how you could fulfil that need, then roll Kind.

Keys:
- heal, treat, aid;
- relate, empathize, inspire, support;
- sway, disarm, placate.

**When you are brave**, describe how you stand against wrong or harm to yourself or to others.

Keys:
- protect, confront, oppose;
- endure, resist, seize, divert;
- encourage, enbolden, empower.

**When you are curious**, tell the other players and the GM what you wish to know more about.

- observe, notice, search;
- meddle, probe, test;
- contact, request, engage.

**When you are mindful**, observe the world around you to find your way forward.
