# common traits

There are 5 Traits: **Kind**, **Brave**, **Curious**, **Cautious**, and **Insightful**.

In broad terms, each Trait represents a form of approaching the world, as well as allowing it to change you.

## trying things

When you try things you must choose a Trait to represent how you express your intention. 

Decide which Trait best applies, which keyword reflects your intention, and describe what you hope will happen.
