# roles

There are two distinct roles to be distributed among the Players in **fantasypunk**: Giramundo, or GM, and Brincante.

Usually a single Player takes the role of GM, while the others take the roles of Brincantes.

In summary, the GM is tasked with creating and fleshing out the world and the setting the other characters inhabit, often creating and controlling Supporting Characters. 

Meanwhile, the Brincantes are in charge of a single character each, a Bearer, and are expected to roleplay them and make decisions about them.

It is recommended that a group, with or withot a GM, have 3 to 5 Brincantes.

## brincante

Each Brincante controls a single character known as Bearer. These are their Agenda and Principles

### agenda

The agenda is a set of overarching goals intended to guide you in play.

- play characters that feel real;
- stir up trouble;
- disrupt the status quo;
- play to **find out what happens**.

### principles

These principles will help you be in the same page with everyone.

- be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- make your character fallible and relatable;
- give your characters something to believe in;
- address the characters, not the Players;
- remind us of your moves;
- take risks and embrace the consequences;
- always ask questions, always answer questions;
- help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

## giramundo

As the Giramundo, or GM, you are a kind counterpoint to the other Players.

Mostly you are expected to provide dramatic situations for the Brincantes, as well as create and run new characters and plot elements, giving them cues to make the Tale more interesting. 

### overview
In short, as a GM, you are expected to introduce a new scene or situation, ask the other Players *"what do you do?"*, and improve the scene or situation according to what the Players do, what their Characters do and what the Dice prompts.

### agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- play to find out what happens;
- sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

### always say

- what the principles demand (as follow);
- what the rules demand;
- what your prep demands;
- what honesty demands.

### principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- talk to the characters, not the Players;
- change the world;
- change the characters;
- favour opportunities over outcomes;
- embrace the fantastic;
- leave blank spaces;
- be a fan of the players and the characters.

# responsibilities

Traditionally, the GM is burdened with organising, hosting, running, and facilitating game sessions.

It is recommended that these responsibilities be shared among the Players involved in order to both alleviate the GM and allow a richer collaborative experience.

## narrative and plot

Making a story cohesive and interesting. When there is a GM present, this is their cue, although a GMless or GMfull game will see this role shared among any number of Players.

## time and space

Managing real world scheduling and “hosting” of game. Any of you may volunteer to take on this role. You are a kind of a host andyour job involves orgnizing when and where everyone meets to play. Tools like when2meet are your best friends.

## hooks and spotlight

Making sure each player and character gets a good amount of time to actively engage in the plot. Again, any player may volunteer to take on this responsibility, although if there is a GM in the game, then the they will be in the best spot to take on this. 

## rules and metaplay

Someone who handles the rules as the table has agreed to them, and edits game and narration around the only relevant parts and be able to introduce others to the rules.Ideally this is a Player that understands the game better than the others, or is more experienced in games like this in general, or both. 

## voice of supporting characters
Speaking for, and acting out the role of supporting characters. Even going as far ass keeping notes on what they do or say or what they are like goes a long way. There are some specific moves that nable this temporarily too.
