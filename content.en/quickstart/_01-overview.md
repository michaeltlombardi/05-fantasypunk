# overview: getting started

This is a short summary of how to start playing fantasypunk.

## setting boundaries

fantasypunk is a roleplaying game where a group of people play pretend mediated by rules and boundaries.

You play by having a conversation that exists within 3 sets of boundaries: the **social** boundaries, where we establish rules and expectations for a healthy conversation; the **fictional** boundaries, where we create and share a Tale, and where we play our roles; and the **abstract** boundaries, where dice and rules attempt to drive and resolve the story in specific or unpredictable directions.

## prepare

1. Assign Roles and Responsibilities to all Players;
2. Agree on how Safety Tools will be employed;
3. Take turns reading the Pillars of Play;
4. Choose an existing scenario or setting, create your own together, or roll 1d6 on the table below:
 
 | 1d6 | Thread                  |
 | --- | ----------------------- |
 | 1   | Sol                     |
 | 2   | Many Moons              |
 | 3   | We, The Monsters        |
 | 4   | Everything is Good      |
 | 5   | Stonetouched            |
 | 6   | A Rock and a Hard Place |

5. Create a Bearer (player character) for each Brincante (players who are not the GM);

## play

6. A GM (a kind of game facilitator) opens a scene by throwing the Bearers into a tricky, dangerous, or otherwise charged situation by describing the place and people they are met with;
7. The Brincantes tell the GM what their characters do, or what they want to happen in the narrative, and if that is an opportunity to make a Move, they make that Move;
8. The GM responds with their own Moves, prompting the Brincantes or their Bearers to respond again or move on to the next scene;
9. Repeat steps 4-7 until the time for play is up or everyone agrees the session should end;

## end of the session

10. when you end the session, decide whether you wish to continue this Tale, or move on to another Tale or another game.
