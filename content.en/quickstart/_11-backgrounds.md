The young bring the future with them, but the elders bring memory.

You have lived and survived through skill, mastery, and experience, and your scars, injuries, and callouses are both witnesses and badges.

You're an ancestor to those who have come later than you, and while your flame may burn less brightly than theirs, it endures through wind and rain without wavering.
