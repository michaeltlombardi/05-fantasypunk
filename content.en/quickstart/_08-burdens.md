# burdens: the weight of your journey

Most of us carry our own weight, then some.

## rely on a burden

When you **rely on a Burden**, describe how you use it or how it comes into play, then add a Burden Die to the dice pool. When you roll, compare its result to the Burden's Weight.

**Roll over:** When you roll over its Weight, your Burden weighs down on you a little as you lean on it. **Make it heavier**.

**Roll under:** When you roll under its Weight, it becomes **too heavy to bear**.

## heighten or alleviate a burden

When you **heighten a Burden**, increase its Weight by 1.

When you **alleviate a Burden**, decrease its Weight by 1.

## crack under your burdens

When you every burden you carry becomes **too heavy to bear,** you **Crack Under Your Burdens**. Make a choice.

**Let go**, however uneasily. 

Erase one of your burdens and describe how it was lost, broken, given away, how it is inaccessible or something else. You are closer to **finding release.**

When you **let go**, **make every remaining burden lighter**.

**Hold on** to it, to the detriment of yourself or others, out of hubris, selfishness, fear or something else.

When you **hold on**, mark 1 Weight as permanent on a Burden. Choose one:

- hurt someone or break something important;
- run or hide from something difficult;
- become a Burden for the Party by going out of commission, or by being trapped or captured without the means to help yourself out of it.
- retire this character at the end of the scene.

## find release

When every Burden you carry is gone amd you **find release**, choose a Change:

alleviate

give in
