# burdens: the weight of your journey

Most of us carry our own weight, then some.

## rely on a burden

When you **rely on a Burden**, describe how you use it or how it comes into play, then add a Burden Die to the dice pool and compare the Weight of the chosen Burden to the result of the Burden Die. 

If the Burden Die is higher, increase this Burden's Weight by 1.

If Weight is higher, then mark this Burden **too heavy to bear**.

## heighten or alleviate a burden

When you **heighten a Burden**, increase its Weight by 1.

When you **alleviate a Burden**, decrease its Weight by 1.

## crack under your burdens

When you every burden you carry becomes **too heavy to bear,** you **Crack Under Your Burdens**. Make a choice.

**Let go**, however uneasily. 

Erase one of your burdens and describe how it was lost, broken, given away, how it is inaccessible, or something else. You are closer to **finding release.**

When you **let go**, **make every remaining burden lighter**.

**Hold on** to it, to the detriment of yourself or others, out of hubris, selfishness, fear or something else.

When you **hold on**, mark 1 Weight as permanent on a Burden. Choose one:

- hurt someone or break something important;
- run or hide from something difficult;
- become a Burden for the Party by going out of commission, or by being trapped or captured without the means to help yourself out of it;
- retire this character at the end of the scene.

## find release

When every Burden you carry is gone amd you **find release**, choose a Change:

- retire this character, describe how;
- make way to the new: an aoorentice becomes a new Party member. Create a new Bearer and make sure at least one of your burdens is a hand me down, or otherwise related to the previous chaacter;
- transformation: choose a new Background for you character an make sure one of their new Burdens is related to their past self.
