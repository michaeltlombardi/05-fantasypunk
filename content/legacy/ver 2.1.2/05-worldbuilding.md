# Themes and Domains

As you explore the world, use Elements and traits to outline the places you find. You can use elements and traits with a hex grid to procedurally generate the map as you travel, or you may instead use it only for landmarks and places of interest.

## 1. Wilderness

Places untouched by folk where our more than human counterparts live in the present, mostly uncaring about our history or futures.

Desires (choose one): quiet, food, be left alone, growth, to observe, to slow down

### GM Moves

This Theme can:

- Provide something needed at a cost or challenge.
- Make sleep difficult or pensive. (reclaim something)
- Strike at you out of need and without malice.

### Domains:

1. **Swamp** - where the wild bogs you down and invites you to be introspective
2. **Coast** - where the wild washes away and calls you to imagine what's beyond
3. **Jungle** - where the wild surrounds you and invites you to observe life abound
4. **Lake** - where the wild is still on the surface and invites you to reflection
5. **Mountain** - where the wild challenges you and invites you to consider your next step
6. **Savanna** - where the wild exposes you and invites you to look at whatâ€™s around you

## 2**. Crossing**

These liminal places mark the transition of what was and what could be. Not quite here, not quite there, but on the way to anywhere, here the journey may phase subtly or shift jarringly into its next stretch.

Desires (choose one): yearning, holding hands, remember last time, to carry rumours, to surprise, to join, to separate, to send off, to meet.

2. **Road** - it challenges you to persist and may introduce you to other journeys.
3. **Gate** - it challenges you to consider which side is truly being kept away and may charge you entry.
4. **Outpost** - it challenges you to question what civilisation is and may warn you of its fears.

## 4. Opportunity

Places where you must gamble with, or struggle against power, risk, and challenge, all the while yearning for something you may or may not know what is - and whether it can be found.
