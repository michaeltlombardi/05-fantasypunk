# Challenges

Sometimes problems require more than a simple, direct approach.

Challenges represent contests, conflict, or complex obstacles that will put the party through the gauntlet.

The prosecutor at a trial, a group of armed soldiers, a troll in the middle of a bridge, children playing tag or a dragon raining fire down on the party are all examples of Challenges.

## Creating a Challenge

1. Determine the nature of the Challenge the party will face.
    
    Examples:
    
    - A debate with the High Magistrate;
    - Traversing a room warded by Magic Sigils;
    - Battling a Fiery Dragon.
2. Define what Angles that Challenge has.
    
    An Angle is a word or short phrase that describes what advantages or actions a Challenge can leverage against the Party.
    
    The more Angles a Challenge has, the harder it is to overcome it.
    
    Look at these examples of Challenges. These are not all of the possible types of challenges, only a few more or less obvious situations.

    - **Survival above all else:** if the dragon becomes certain it's losing the upper hand, it will attempt to break out.
    - **Dragon Fire**: The dragon's fire causes a magical burn that causes otherworldly pain and can only be fully healed with special magic.

## Overcoming Challenges

Overcoming a Challenge doesn't mean necessarily overcoming each and all of its Angles, as the fiction changes every time the party overcomes an Angle.

For example: by overcoming the Fiery Dragon's Cunning, the dragon will change tactics to a more direct and dangerous approach, which could mean that the characters now have more opportunities against it, but may also mean that the dragon will hit more recklessly.

Some Challenges might be overcome by defeating only some of its Angles.

For example: by defusing the Illusion Magic and the Trapped Control Pannel, the characters might be able to punch a command that will allow them to move forward before the Sigils go off.

Maybe by pursuing complete defeat of the Challenge, the party might earn a greater benefit, while the overall cost might be higher as a downside.
