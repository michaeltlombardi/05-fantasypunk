# The Guide and Mediator

## Agenda

- Play to find out what happens;
- Portray a world full of diverse, complex people;
- Create opportunities to do systemic good;
- Let the players struggle against those who choose to become monsters.

## Always say

- What the principles demand (as follow).
- What the rules demand.
- What your prep demands.
- What honesty demands.

## Principles

Your role is to describe the world, its contents, and the outcomes of actions.

- Create problems, not solutions;
- Embrace the fantastic;
- Address the characters, not the players;
- Name everyone, make everyone a person;
- Make a Move that follows;
- Never speak the name of your Move;
- Ask questions, use the answers;
- Be a fan of their characters;
- Pass the spotlight;
- Think dangerous;
- Begin and end with the fiction;
- Think offscreen too;
- Don't shut them down;
- Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.

## GM Moves

When a player rolls a miss, or you need to know what happens next, use one of these GM moves:

### Warn them

- Show signs of trouble elsewhere;
- Start a clock or tick a clock;

### Rob Them

- Steal, damage, or break something or someone;

### Injure Them

- Hurt them or their friends;
- Damage or destroy their things;

### Twist The Outcome

- Offer success at a cost;
- Offer a difficult choice;
- Offer a partial success;
- Give what they think they want;
- Show the downside of their things;

### Escalate

- Separate them;
- Introduce new problems;
- Make the situation worse.

## Clocks

![A set of four clocks, each one a circle divided in 4, 6, 8 and 6 segments, respectively. The last clock has two segments painted.](the%20Guide%20and%20Mediator%207e85fe273de642288314b0af17e1dccb/clocks-black.png)

A set of four clocks, each one a circle divided in 4, 6, 8 and 6 segments, respectively. The last clock has two segments painted.

Clocks are a way of keeping track of events and action that happens in the background. While not literal timepieces, they make the world feel as though it is moving even if the players are not.

Divide a circle into sections as needed. Start it full, empty or halfway. Tick it up or down as events occur, and trigger new events when it fills or empties. Track things like resources, situations, travel, threats, hunger, XP, etc.

 Some clocks are visible to everyone, others are hidden since the players may not know about everything that happens in the world.

## Threats

Different kinds of threats have extra, more specific GM moves to inspire you.

### Cursed Places

- Shift, move, rearrange
- Disgorge something
- Lure someone in
- Leave a mark on someone

### Overlords

- Attack suddenly, directly, forcefully
- Seize something or someone for leverage or information
- Negotiate, promise, demand
- Claim territory

### Swarms

- Grow in size
- Raise a champion
- Overwhelm

### Afflictions

- Make the smallest thing a struggle
- Spread to someone new
- Present a false perception

### Terrors

- Appear from nowhere
- Inflict horror upon a victim
