# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all party members at all times.

# Expression Moves

> 📍 _Currently this section of the text assumes that you have more familiarity with TTRPGs than other parts of the game._

When you express your thoughts, feelings and actions, most of the time you do that through an expression move.

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 0d6 instead.

You can only roll for a move if you have at least 2d6. So if you need more dice, you might need to rely on your Baggage or Push Your Luck.

When a specialized move asks you to be Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, roll as many d6 as established and continue following that move’s instructions.

Expression Moves are open-ended, which means you must decide what you wish to do and how you approach that choice. Discuss with the GM and the rest of the Party whether you wish to interact with the world fictionally, mechanically or both, and then roll.

> Tip - Mechanics you could interact with: a clock, an angle, a burden, an obligation, a debt, the dice.

### When should you make these moves?

Expression moves cover a very wide array of actions, so it is tempting to make these moves and roll the dice every time.

On the other hand, there’s plenty that your characters should know or be able to do as second nature, without even thinking about it.

When you need to make an Expression Move, discuss with the party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true.

- I have enought practice or experience at this I don't need to think about it.
- I have time and freedom to do it leisurely.
- I am empowered or supplied by the knowledge and tools necessary.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll. Discuss with the GM and your party members how you do the thing you want to.

If two statements are true, take +1d6 forward.

If one statement is true, make your move and roll the dice as usual.

If none of these statements are true, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all. It might be possible, but much harder or with diminished returns.
