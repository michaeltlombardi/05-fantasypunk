**fantasypunk** is a game of incredible and fallible characters, the way they approach the world around them, and the baggage they carry.

Together we will weave tales of wanderers, travelers, the found and the lost, the seekers and the runaways, the people they meet, the friends they make along the way, and the communities they are part of or drop from.

If you want to play a hypercapitalist murder-pillage power fantasy, this is not the game for you; please refer to that racist dragon game of colonization owned by white billionaires.

If you choose to be a bigot, a racist, a fascist, a nazi, make yourself a favour and crawl back into the slimy pit your crawled out from and stay away from anything I make.

After all, the real monsters are those who choose to be monsters.
