# fantasypunk

*There is a crack in everything. That is how the light gets in.* - Leonard Cohen

Heroes are often thought of as paragons of strength, wisdom, or virtue who always seem to figure out what to do, or always get the specific help they need when they get stuck. They seem to never face hopelessness or loss for too long, or only for long enough to turn those into yet another form of power.

So they stride across the land, stomping over every challenge in their path, destroying everything that opposes them, and disregarding all folk, magic, or nature that happen to be in their way.

The tales told here are not about them.

The tales told here are about much more fallible people. Complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people. The people who create problems and who solve problems, and how often both are the same people.

No one can guarantee that the rough-edged and jaded stories told here won't be, in time, worn down by the tongues of storytellers into shapes perfectly smooth, rounded, and solid.

But until then, let's look at what burdens those complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people carry, and how they crack under their weight.

# What is fantasypunk?

**fantasypunk** is a game of incredible and fallible characters, the way they approach the world around them, and the burdens they carry.

Together we will weave tales of wanderers, travellers, the found and the lost, the seekers and the runaways, the people they meet, the friends they make along the way, and the communities they are part of or drop from.

If you want to play a hypercapitalist murder-pillage power fantasy, this is not the game for you; please refer to that racist dragon game of colonization owned by white billionaires.

If you choose to be a bigot, a racist, a fascist, a nazi, make yourself a favour and crawl back into the slimy pit your crawled out from.

After all, the real, true monsters are those who choose to be monsters.
