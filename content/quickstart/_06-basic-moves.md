# 6 - Basic Moves

# Approaches

More important than what tools, powers or skills you have, your Traits represent how you approach the world around you.

There is no right or wrong choice of Traits to approach a situation; each Trait prompts certain questions or possibilities, fundamentally asking you, "what is your intention, and how do you act on it?", and then everyone finds out what happens.

## Be Kind

When you are **kind**, choose the one Key that best reflects your intention:

- heal, treat, aid;
- relate, inspire, support;
- sway, disarm, placate.

 Describe how you pursue your intention through your words or deeds, then roll the dice.

- Solid Hit: ask the other PCs and the GM what their character, a place or another entity needs the most.
- Messy Hit: **embrace a shortcoming**.
- Miss: **brace yourself**.

## Be Brave

When you are **brave**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- protect, confront, oppose;
- endure, resist, seize, divert;
- encourage, embolden, empower.

On a Fine Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM how you can stand against wrong or harm, to yourself or to others.

On an Ordinary Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Curious

When you are **curious**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- observe, study, search;
- meddle, probe, test;
- contact, request, engage.

On a Fine Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM about something you wish to know more about.

On an Ordinary Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Careful

When you are **careful**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- respect, watch, learn;
- disarm, dissuade, divert;
- prepare, plan, position.

On a Fine Hit, ask the other PCs and the GM about the world around you to find your way forward.

On an Ordinary Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Be Insightful

When you are **insightful**, choose 1 key to set your intentions and describe how you hope to achieve them through words or deeds. Roll the dice as established.

Keys:
- wonder, portend, imagine;
- sense, probe, trust, appease;
- attune, empower, inspire.

On a Fine Hit,  open your senses to the wondrous and otherworldly, then ask the other PCs and the GM what you find.

On an Ordinary Hit, **embrace a shortcoming**.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

# Resolution Moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## Embrace a Shortcoming

When you **embrace a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or roll 1d6 to let the dice choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose a Shortcoming before you roll and add 1d6 to the Dice Pool.

1. you make a **mistake**, wether you realize it now or later;
2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## Brace Yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit. 

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## Push Back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **give up** an item from your Baggage.

# Trust Moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## Offer Help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you share the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## Get in the Way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

- If they say yes, **load up**;
- If they say no, they **load up**.

If you give them no choice, **take a Burden**.
