# 5 - the conversation: roleplaying, moves and dice

**fantasypunk** is played as a kind of conversation where everyone is adding something to the tale to take it into fun and interesting directions.

What makes it different from any other conversation is the unique boundaries provided by the pillars, the setting, the principles, and the agenda.

Many times, the GM will propose a situation, offer details or escalate the drama, prompting the PCs to act or react to it.

The GM will respond in kind and so on and so forth.

Sometimes the PCs choose to do something bold, take a risk, raise the stakes, face opposition... or most likely just do something cool to see what happens.

That's when Moves come into play, usually asking the dice what direction the tale should go.

## making moves

All you have to do to make a move is read the move and follow its instructions, asking and answering any questions, and interpreting open ended promps.

You can also make some moves just because you want to stir the pot, or just because, whatever you feel like in the moment.

These are the most relevant moves:

- Approach Moves: These moves are based on your traits, Kind, Brave, Curious, Careful and Insightful. Set your intentions, roll the dice and describe what you do;
- Special Moves: Special moves usually require that you be Kind, Brave, Curious, Careful or Insightful. In short, make an Approach Move:

> Make an Approach Move > Roll the dice > On a solid hit, resolve the Approach move > Resolve the Special Move

## the dice pool

When a move asks you to roll the dice, it's prompting you to pool together all the dice provided by your Traits, Burdens, situational modifiers, and so on, roll them all, then keep the highest two results, adding them together.

- Start with 1d6 from a Trait ( ), 2d6 from a Striving Trait (+) and no dice from a Struggling Trait (-);
- You get +1d6 from Relying on your Burdens;
- You get +1d6 from a +1 Forward or a +1 Ongoing. Having both won't stack;
- You get +1d6 when you **Start Uneven** (See basic moves).

If you don't get enough dice to roll at least 2d6 when you make a move, you should just consider it a miss.

On the other hand, you can't have a pool bigger than 5d6. Just ignore any dice above that.

### hits and misses

See the results and outcomes from rolling a 2d6 dice roll. When in doubt, use the third column to help you interpret the result of a move.

Result | Outcome      | Meaning
-------|--------------|---------------
12     | Critical hit | Yes, and
10-11  | Solid hit    | Yes
7-9    | Messy hit    | Yes, but
1-6    | Miss         | Brace Yourself

Not all moves have a specific effect for a Critical Hit. In those cases, interpret it as a Solid Hit.

## the burden die

When you roll a Burden Die, keep track of its result, regardless of whether you add it to the final roll or not.

> Tip: use a die of a different colour or size, or always count the first die you roll in the pool as the Burden Die if one is being rolled.
