# fictional pillars: collaborative common ground

**fantasypunk** assumes that the pillars below are always true in the shared fiction of any Tale that emerges from playing this game:

- **heroic fantasy:** the world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around you;
- **wondrous and mundane:** magic exists and it is wondrous and wild, althout it is hardly world breaking, if at all;
- **humanity is relative:** people are complicated, diverse, and often conflicted but are mostly kind and willing to do good;
- **monstrosity is relative:** the real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency;
- **no hat fits all:** no individuals, communities, religions or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive.

Each unique setting or world you create for your games can include new Pillars, or iterate on these ones bring the Tale to life.
