# roles

There are two distinct roles to be distributed among the Players in **fantasypunk**: the Giramundo, or GM, and the Player Characters, or PCs

Usually a single Player takes the role of GM, while the others take the roles of Player Characters.



## player characters

### agenda

The agenda is a set of overarching goals intended to guide you in play.

- play characters that feel real;
- stir up trouble;
- disrupt the status quo;
- play to **find out what happens**.

### principles

These principles will help you put everyone in the same page.

- be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- make your character fallible and relatable;
- give your characters something to believe in;
- address the party, not the players;
- remind us of your moves;
- take risks and embrace the consequences;
- always ask questions, always answer questions;
- help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

## giramundo

As the Giramundo, or GM, you are a kind counterpoint to the other Players.

Your main responsibility is to provoke dramatic situations for the PCs.

It’s okay to learn as you go, too. The core of the game is mostly in the Common and Remarkable Moves.

### overview
In short, as a GM, you are expected to introduce a new scene or situation, ask the other Players *"what do you do?"*, and improve the scene or situation according to what the Players do, what their Characters do and what the Dice prompts.

### agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- play to find out what happens;
- sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

### always say

- what the principles demand (as follow);
- what the rules demand;
- what your prep demands;
- what honesty demands.

### principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- talk to the characters, not the players;
- change the world;
- change the characters;
- favour opportunities over outcomes;
- embrace the fantastic;
- leave blank spaces;
- be a fan of the players and the characters.
