# roles

There are two distinct roles to be distributed among the Players in **fantasypunk**: Giramundo, or GM, and Andejo.

Usually a single Player takes the role of GM, while the others take the roles of Andejos.

In summary, the GM is usually creating and fleshing out the world and the setting the other characters inhabit, often creating and controlling Supporting Characters. 

Meanwhile, the Andejos usually will bein charge of a single character, a Party Companion, and are expected to roleplay them and make decisions about them.

It is recommended that a group, with or withot a GM, have 3 to 5 Andejos.

## andejo

Each Andejo controls a single character known as Party Comrade, or PC.

### agenda

The agenda is a set of overarching goals intended to guide you in play.

- play characters that feel real;
- stir up trouble;
- disrupt the status quo;
- play to **find out what happens**.

### principles

These principles will help you put everyone in the same page.

- be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- make your character fallible and relatable;
- give your characters something to believe in;
- address the party, not the players;
- remind us of your moves;
- take risks and embrace the consequences;
- always ask questions, always answer questions;
- help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

## giramundo

As the Giramundo, or GM, you are a kind counterpoint to the other Players.

Mostly you are expected to provide dramatic situations for the Andejos, as well as create and run new characters and plot elements.

### overview
In short, as a GM, you are expected to introduce a new scene or situation, ask the other Players *"what do you do?"*, and improve the scene or situation according to what the Players do, what their Characters do and what the Dice prompts.

### agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- play to find out what happens;
- sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

### always say

- what the principles demand (as follow);
- what the rules demand;
- what your prep demands;
- what honesty demands.

### principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- talk to the characters, not the players;
- change the world;
- change the characters;
- favour opportunities over outcomes;
- embrace the fantastic;
- leave blank spaces;
- be a fan of the players and the characters.

# responsibilities

Traditionally, the GM is burdened with organising, hosting, running, and facilitating game sessions.

It is recommended that these responsibilities be shared among the Players involved in order to both alleviate the GM and allow a richer collaborative experience.

## narrative and plot

Making a story cohesive and interesting

## time and space

Managing real world scheduling and “hosting” of game

## hooks and spotlight

Making sure each player and character gets a good amount of time to actively engage in the plot

## rules and metaplay

Someone who handles the rules as the table has agreed to them, and edits game and narration around the only relevant parts and be able to introduce others to the rules. 

## voice of NPCs
Speaking for, and acting out the role of NPCs
