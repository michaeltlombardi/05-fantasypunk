# 6 - core moves

All characters have access to these moves at any time.

## play your role

> Do this to create a collaborative tale without the need for dice or other rules.

When you want to express how your character acts, moves and feels, towards any aspect of the Tale or in response to anyone else's moves, **play your role**.

Describe or roleplay what your character says and does, and develop the narrative together with the rest of the Party and the GM.

There is no cost or gain in terms of dice other mechanics, this is a freeform action that includes anything that doesn't present any serious risk, challenge, or chance.

## give it a try

> Do this to decide whether your character is in a position to tro something particularly tricky, risky or uncertain before they make another move.

When you **give something a try**, determine with the Party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true:

- I have a Unique Trait that is especially relevant now;
- I have the time and freedom to go about it without pressure;
- I carry knowledge or tools that are especially relevant now, in the form of Burdens or otherwise.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll, and **play your role** as usual.

If two statements are true, you can **take a chance** with +1d6. If only one statement is true, you can **take a chance** as usual.

If no statements are true, you should consider whether you can try this at all.

## take a chance
> Do this to try somethiung tricky, risky or uncertain, and determine the outcome of your move.

When you **take a chance**, choose an Approach and describe what you hope will happen.

- **critical hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass *and* you may choose one: **take an opportunity** or **avoid a shortcoming**.
- **solid hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass as intended.
- **messy hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass, *but* **take a shortcoming**.
- **miss**: you must **brace yourself**.

## have a say
> Do this to directly influence the narrative as a player rather than through roleplaying your character.

When you want to **have a say** on the Tale to create a new aspect, or elaborate on an existing one, make a Proposal.

Choose one of the options below and describe your Proposal to the other Players.

- create or elaborate on a location;
- create or elaborate on a relationship;
- create or elaborate on an event;
- create or elaborate on a GM character not present or that you're about to meet, and take over that character during this scene.

Take 1d6 from your Personal Pool and go around the group asking each Player if they agree with your Proposal. Anyone who agrees hands over one dice from their pool.

If everyone agrees on the Proposal, it just happens.

If one or more Players did not offer you a die, ask those players “What will happen if I don’t roll a 6?", and they will suggest one or more Alternatives.

Roll the dice you have collected. If you get a 6, the proposal happens. Otherwise, choose one of the Alternatives presented.

Add all of the collected dice to the Party Pool.

## seek answers

When you **seek answers** about an aspect of the Tale, ask one of the questions below to no one in particular.

- what is the relationship between --- and --- ?
- what do I know about --- that no one else does?
- what is the running roumor on --- ?
- what should --- do (about ---)?
- what opportunity have we completely missed here?

Offer a Personal Die to any player who answer the question you chose. 

When another Player answer your question, give them the die you offered and prompt them to clarify their answer as needed.

# follow up moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## listen to intuition

When you **give it a try** and roll a critical hit, your intuition allows you to ask the GM or another Player a question according to the Trait you choose as an approach.

- **Kind:** on a critical hit, ask the GM or another Player what their character, a place, or another entity needs the most;
- **Brave:** on a critical hit, ask the GM or another Player how you can best stand against wrong or harm, to yourself or to others;
- **Curious:** on a critical hit, ask the GM or another Player what feelings or movements are really going on below the surface;
- **Cautious:** on a critical hit, ask the GM or another Player what is the best way to move forward, get out or get away;
- **Insightful:** on a critical hit, ask the GM or another Player what they think the best course of action is.

## take a shortcoming

When you **take a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or let an **oracle die** choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose an option below before you roll and add +1d6 to the Dice Pool.

1. you make a **mistake**, whether you realize it now or later;
2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## brace yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit.

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## push back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **lessen a Burden**.

# intervention moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## offer help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, give them 1d6 from your Personal Pool to add to their roll immediately. Both of you describe how you do it and share the outcome of the chance you just took.

## get in the way

When you **get in someone's way**, you may give them a choice and ask that Player whether their Bearer or supporting character suffers interference from you.

- If they say yes, they must take a die from your Personal Pool for their own, otherwise you **heighten one of your Burdens**, and they describe what goes sideways, and how;
- If they say no, they must yield one die from their Personal pool to the Party pool, otherwise they **heighten one of their Burdens**.

If you give them no choice at all, make one of your Burdens **too heavy to bear**, and you describe the outcome of your interference.

## make a group effort

When multiple Bearers **make a group effort**, all Brincantes involved decide what a solid hit, a messy hit and a miss look like.

Each Brincante must roll 1d6 from the Party Pool, then all PCs add the highest 2d6 together.

If there aren't enough Dice for all Players involved, any player may **heighten a burden** once to provide a die from their own Personal Pool to another Player.

All dice used this way are spent and don't return to either Pool.

# care moves

These moves codify a set of safety tools into the game procedures.

## take a step back

When any Player decides to **take a step back**, stop the game immediately to provide listening and support.

When you need a moment to react to what's happening in the game, tell the other Players you are **taking a step back**.

Inform the rest of the table of your need and engage any tools you need to accommodate them.

## “do we want to?”

When you’re not sure everyone is on board with the chosen course of action you chose, **take a step back** and ask: **"Do we want to?"** to express that you’d like everyone to buy in.

## “Where to next?”

If you feel the adventure came to a standstill or that you are stuck, **take a step back** and ask “Where to next?” to discuss what to do to move the adventure forward.

## “What do you think?”

Sometimes we need a bit of extra time to think, focus or express ourselves. If someone seems quieter or seems to be speaking less, **take a step back** and ask “What do you think?” to check how they are feeling.

## “hold on.”

When you need a break for some water and self-care, or because something happened that is making someone uncomfortable, or because you want to look back at something from earlier, **take a step back** and say “Hold on.”

## “no.”

You shouldn’t do something you don’t want to. If you feel you need to change something to fit your needs or to have agency over your character or the world around you, say “No", then **take a step back**.

## step away

The base assumption is that the game is being productive and that issues and problems can be navigated safely through conversation. If that’s not the case you can leave at any moment.

When any player chooses to step away, **take a step back** to talk about it.
