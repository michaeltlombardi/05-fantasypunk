# the conversation: roleplaying, moves and dice

**fantasypunk** is played as a kind of conversation where everyone involved takes part in creating a Tale by adding something to take it into fun and interesting directions.

What makes it different from any casual conversation is the unique boundaries provided by the social rules, the narrative rules, and the system rules.

Most times, the conversation revolves around a cycle that starts with the GM describing a situation, the Andejos acting or reacting to it on behalf of their PCs, and the GM describing how the situation changed.

Sometimes the PCs choose to do something bold, take a risk, raise the stakes, face opposition... or most likely just do something cool to see what happens, which usually results in asking the dice in what direction the tale should go.

## doing things

Both the GM and the Andejos have a set of actions to describe the world, what their characters do, and how they all change each other.

- **play your role**:  describe what your character says and does. Remember to follow your Principles and Agenda as best as you can;
- **give it a try**: figure out whether you should be able to do a thing;
- **take a chance**: roll the dice to find out what happens when you do something particularly tricky, risky or uncertain;
- **have a say**: 









## making moves

All you have to do to make a move is read the move and follow its instructions, asking and answering any questions, and interpreting open ended promps.

You can also make some moves just because you want to stir the pot, or just because, whatever you feel like in the moment.

These are the most relevant moves:

- **Core Moves** are the essential and most basic rules for creating a shared Tale. 
    - **Play your Role** is what you do most of the time you are not rolling dice. When you describe what your character feels and expresses, you are roleplaying;
    - **Give it a Try** covers most rolls the Player Characters make. Answer the promps, choose a Trait and roll to find out what happens;
    - 

- **Party Care Moves** are a set of actions that ask the players to step away from the tale for a moment to take care of each other. Talk about them before you start playing.

- **Remarkable Moves** allow you to do something, or Give it a Try, under special conditions and with unique outcomes. They expand your options and possibilities and make characters even more unique.

> Make an Approach Move > Roll the dice > On a solid hit, resolve the Approach move > Resolve the Special Move

## the dice pool

Most times when you roll the dice, pool together each die provided by your Traits, Burdens, situational modifiers, and so on, roll them all, then keep the highest two results, adding them together.

- Start with 1d6 from a Trait ( ), 2d6 from a Striving Trait (+) and no dice from a Struggling Trait (-);
- You get +1d6 from Relying on your Burdens;
- You get +1d6 from a +1 Forward or a +1 Ongoing. Having both won't stack;
- You get +1d6 when you **Start Uneven** (See basic moves);
- Other things may give you more dice.

If you don't get enough dice to roll at least 2d6 when you make a move, you should just consider it a miss, or maybe reconsider your approach.

### hits and misses

See the results and outcomes from rolling a 2d6 dice roll. When in doubt, use the third column to help you interpret the result of a move.

Result | Outcome      | Meaning
-------|--------------|---------------
12     | Critical hit | Yes, and
10-11  | Solid hit    | Yes
7-9    | Messy hit    | Yes, but
1-6    | Miss         | Brace Yourself

Not all moves have a specific effect for a Critical Hit. In those cases, interpret it as a Solid Hit.

## the burden die

When you roll a Burden Die, keep track of its result, regardless of whether you add it to the final roll or not.

> Tip: always count the die that falls further away from you, or use a die of a different colour or size, or always count the first die you roll in the pool as the Burden Die.
