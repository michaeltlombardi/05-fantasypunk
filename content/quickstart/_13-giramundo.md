# the giramundo: the guide and mediator

As the Giramundo, or GM, you are a kind of host, facilitator, and counterpoint to the other Players.

Your main job is to help provoke dramatic situations for the PCs and be able to introduce others to the rules. 

It’s okay to learn as you go, too. The core of the game is mostly in the Common and Remarkable Moves.

## agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- Play to find out what happens;
- Sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- Make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

## always say

- What the principles demand (as follow);
- What the rules demand;
- What your prep demands;
- What honesty demands.

## principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- Talk to the Characters, not the Players;
- Change the World;
- Change the Characters;
- Favour Opportunities over Outcomes;
- Embrace the fantastic;
- Leave Blank Spaces;
- Be a Fan of the Players AND the Characters.
