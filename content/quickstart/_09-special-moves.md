# Special Moves

## Song of Silence

When you are **Kind**, you may look at what is really going on below, and create space for someone to air their burdens and help tend them.

On a solid hit, **lighten their Burdens**;

On a messy hit, ask out loud, “Is there a way to heal or ease ___?“

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Well of Wisdom

When you are **Kind**, you may look into your seemingly endless well of anecdotes in an attempt to reach someone’s heart with a story.

On a solid hit, take +1 forward when interacting with them, or give them +1 forward.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Confront

When you are **Brave**, **confront** someone with words or deeds.

On any hit, they must drop everything and deal with you.

On a critical hit, choose 2. On a solid hit, choose 1.

- You drive them scrambling back.
- You lash out, wounding or dismaying them.
- You seize hold of them.
- You throw them off-balance.
- You shock and startle them and they panic or freeze.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Against the Odds

When you’re backed in a corner, be Brave. On a sound hit, choose 1 and ask the GM or the other PCs to answer:

- You have an unexpected ally. Ask who it is.
- You have a desperate opportunity. Ask what it is.
- You have a sudden realization. Ask or tell the others what it is.
- You find reserves of speed, strength, or endurance. Tell the others what you can do.
- You have a piece of amazing luck. Ask or tell the others what it is.

On a messy hit, the GM or another PC chooses 1 for you. 

On a miss, you are good and cornered. **Brace yourself**.

## I Know a Guy

When you are Curious, you can name an old contact who could help you, and seek them out.

On a solid hit, they can help, though you might need to make it worth their while.

On a messy hit, pick 1:

- They can help, but they need your help first.
- They’re going to ask for a lot.
- They’re not quite cut out for this.
- You can’t exactly trust them.

On a miss, **brace yourself**. 

## Scrutinize

When you are Curious you can try to scrutinize your surroundings.

On a critical hit, pick 2. On a solid hit, pick 1:

- Others won't notice your scrutiny;
- You locate something interesting or useful;
- You find a way in, out or through.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Birdwatcher

When you are **cautious,** you can hide in plain sight to gather information.

On a critical hit, tell the others what information you have learned, then discuss how it will best fit the scene. Take +1 forward to act on this information.

On a solid hit, you learn something relevant or interesting to you. The GM or another PC will tell you what it is. Take +1 forward to act on this information.

On a messy hit, **brace yourself.**

## Infiltrator

When you are Cautious, you can try to climb or squeeze into a hard-to-reach place.

On a solid hit, you reach it without much trouble.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

## Ritual Spellcasting

When you are **insightful**, you can cast a spell you know by performing a magical ritual.

On a solid hit pick 1 option that takes effect as you cast your spell:

- the spell effect lasts longer or otherwise is harder to be undone;
- choose an additional key to make that move;
- your Burdens won't get heavier as you *rely* on a spell from it.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.


## Weave and Loom

When you are **insightful**, you can attempt to undo or avert ruin or harm.

On a solid hit, pick 1:

- Make something whole again;
- Detect malice or a threat of harm;
- Tug at something or someone out of reach to catch a glimpse of its current state.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.
