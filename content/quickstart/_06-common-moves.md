# 6 - common moves

All characters have access to these moves at any time.

## give it a try

When you give things a try or take a chance, determine with the Party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true:

> - I have a Unique Trait that is especially relevant now;
> - I have the time and freedom to go about it without pressure;
> - I carry knowledge or tools that are especially relevant now, in the form of Burdens or otherwise.

If all statements are true you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll.

Otherwise, choose an Approach and describe what you hope will happen.

- When two statements are true, take +1d6, and roll the dice.
- When one statement is true, roll the dice as usual.

On a **critical hit**, the outcome you hoped for comes to pass *and* you may choose one: **take +1 forward or avoid a shortcoming**.

On a **messy hit**, the outcome you hoped for comes to pass, *but* take a **shortcoming**.

On a **miss** you must **brace yourself**.

# reaction moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## embrace a shortcoming

When you **embrace a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or roll 1d6 to let the dice choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose a Shortcoming before you roll and add 1d6 to the Dice Pool.

1. you make a **mistake**, whether you realize it now or later;
2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## brace yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit.

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## push back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **give up** a Burden.

# meddling moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## offer help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you share the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## get in the way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

- If they say yes, **heighten a Burden**;
- If they say no, they **heighten a Burden**.

If you give them no choice, make one of your Burdens **too heavy to bear**.

> ## The Team Roll Off 
> 
> When multiple players want to work together to successfully complete a task, they decide what a success, mixed success and failure look like. 
> 
> R, Q and D are trying to scale the outside of a building together. They agree that mixed success is that they get spotted. Failure means someone falls. They decide it will be D’s character. 
> 
> Then, they all roll a dice. If there is a match, they succeed. If the difference between the highest and lowest result is 2 or less, they achieve mixed success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. 
> 
> Example #1: R rolls a 5. Q rolls a 4. D rolls a 1. There are no matches. And the difference between the highest (5) and the lowest (1) is more than 2 so it’s a failure. 
> 
> Example #2: R rolls 4. Q rolls 4. D rolls a 5. It’s a success!

# party care moves

These moves codify a set of safety tools into the game procedures.

## take a step back

When any Player decides to **take a step back**, stop the game immediately to provide listening and support.

When you need a moment to react to what's happening in the game, tell the other Players you are **taking a step back**.

Inform the rest of the table of your need and engage any tools you need to accommodate them.

## “do we want to?”

When you’re not sure everyone is on board with the chosen course of action you chose, **take a step back** and ask: **"Do we want to?"** to express that you’d like everyone to buy in.

## “Where to next?”

If you feel the adventure came to a standstill or that you are stuck, **take a step back** and ask “Where to next?” to discuss what to do to move the adventure forward.

## “What do you think?”

Sometimes we need a bit of extra time to think, focus or express ourselves. If someone seems quieter or seems to be speaking less, **take a step back** and ask “What do you think?” to check how they are feeling.

## “hold on.”

When you need a break for some water and self-care, or because something happened that is making someone uncomfortable, or because you want to look back at something from earlier, **take a step back** and say “Hold on.”

## “no.”

You shouldn’t do something you don’t want to. If you feel you need to change something to fit your needs or to have agency over your character or the world around you, say “No", then **take a step back**.

## step away

The base assumption is that the game is being productive and that issues and problems can be navigated safely through conversation. If that’s not the case you can leave at any moment.

When any player chooses to step away, **take a step back** to talk about it.
