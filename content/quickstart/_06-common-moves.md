# 6 - common moves

All characters have access to these moves at any time.

# approach  moves

Your Traits represent how you approach the world around you.

There is no right or wrong choice of Traits to approach a situation; each Trait prompts certain questions or possibilities, fundamentally asking you, "what is your intention, and how do you act on it?", and then everyone finds out what happens.

When you need to make an Approach Move, discuss with the party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true.

- I have enought practice or experience at this I don't need to think about it;
- I have time and freedom to do it leisurely;
- I am empowered or supplied by the knowledge or tools necessary.

> Does the 1st question bond with any specific mechanical spot?
> Does the 3rd question ask about Burdens?

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll.

If two statements are true, take +1d6 forward.

If one statement is true, make your move and roll the dice as usual.

If none of these statements are true, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all. It might be possible, but much harder or with diminished returns.

# reaction moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## embrace a shortcoming

When you **embrace a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or roll 1d6 to let the dice choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose a Shortcoming before you roll and add 1d6 to the Dice Pool.

2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## brace yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit.

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## push back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **give up** a Burden.

# meddling moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## offer help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you share the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## get in the way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

- If they say yes, **heighten a Burden**;
- If they say no, they **heighten a Burden**.

If you give them no choice, make one of your Burdens **too heavy to bear**.

# party care moves

These moves codify a set of safety tools into the game procedures.

## take a step back

When any Player decides to **take a step back**, stop the game immediately to provide listening and support.

When you need a moment to react to what's happening in the game, tell the other Players you are **taking a step back**.

Inform the rest of the table of your need and engage any tools you need to accommodate them.

## “do we want to?”

When you’re not sure everyone is on board with the chosen course of action you chose, **take a step back** and ask: **"Do we want to?"** to express that you’d like everyone to buy in.

## “Where to next?”

If you feel the adventure came to a standstill or that you are stuck, **take a step back** and ask “Where to next?” to discuss what to do to move the adventure forward.

## “What do you think?”

Sometimes we need a bit of extra time to think, focus or express ourselves. If someone seems quieter or seems to be speaking less, **take a step back** and ask “What do you think?” to check how they are feeling.

## “hold on.”

When you need a break for some water and self-care, or because something happened that is making someone uncomfortable, or because you want to look back at something from earlier, **take a step back** and say “Hold on.”

## “no.”

You shouldn’t do something you don’t want to. If you feel you need to change something to fit your needs or to have agency over your character or the world around you, say “No", then **take a step back**.

## step away

The base assumption is that the game is being productive and that issues and problems can be navigated safely through conversation. If that’s not the case you can leave at any moment.

When any player chooses to step away, **take a step back** to talk about it.
