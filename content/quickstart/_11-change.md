# draft

> this section is a draft and a WIP.

## meditate

When you are safe and can recall your journeys to **meditate** over how you changed, roll 1d6 for each of the below (you can roll more than 4d6):

- You grew as a player;
- Your PC was challenged;
- You and the table had fun;
- Your PC lost something great;
- Your PC shared something unique.

On a solid hit, take both, on a messy hit, choose one.

- Get 1 Vision Token;
- Get 2 Flashback Tokens.

On a miss, take +1 forward when you make this move again.

### recall a flashback

When you **recall a Flashback**, you invoke a past action or situation to conveniently produce a resource, material, or otherwise, to advance the tale.

- spend 1 Flashback token to invoke an action or a situation that you ordinarily would have access to or an opportunity for;
- spend 2 Flashback tokens to invoke a more complex action or situation that probably required some preparation, a unique opportunity, or being in the right place at the rightr time.

After you spend your tokens and frame the scene, choose the appropriate Approach move and roll the dice.

On any result, hit or miss, you get what you wanted. You still must account for any Shortcomings or Brace Yourself on a miss.

### look forward to the horizon

When you **look forward to the horizon**

- Add or replace a Move;
- Add or replace a Burden;
- Clear all Weight from all Burdens;
- Swap any two traits;
- Change your Unique Trait
- Change your Background;
- **THINK ABOUT**:
- Pass On The Torch - 
- Change the World;
- Seize Your Destiny;
- Enter the Legend;

### quest?

A quest is a story in miniature, a piece of plot and character development that a player or the whole group initiates and receives rewards for engaging with. 

It can represent an in-fiction request, favor, or mission issued by one character to another, but it doesn’t have to! 

A quest can instead be intensely personal, an accounting of a character grappling with a decision, responsibility, doubt, or any other facet of life that showcases their development and can be marked with a beginning and end.

To build a quest, write the following:

- The name of the quest
- A short description to remind players of the quest’s context
- A few (typically four or five) beats that, when enacted, earn a minor experience token
- One or two possible conclusions that, when they come to pass, finish the quest and earn a major experience token

A quest can be personal to a specific character, in which case only that character can earn tokens from it or complete it. A quest can also be shared by the group. For a group quest, anyone can perform one of its beats to earn a minor token, and when you bring the quest to a conclusion together, everyone gets a major token!

Example Group Quest: The Queen is Dead

Mathille, the widow Queen of Vadras, has died. According to the traditions of the monarchy, her eldest daughter Nehamara is to ascend the throne. But her twin brother, Esdrech, was away at war when the news fell, and he now returns to the castle with most of the Vadran army under his command. Few believe that he will quietly bend the knee to his sister.

Once per scene, earn a minor experience token when you:

● Question someone about where their loyalties lie
● Declare your own loyalty to one of the scions
● Share a memory of the late Queen
● Speculate as to what the reign of Nehamara or Esdrech would be like
● Don a symbol of mourning

Complete this quest, earning a major experience token for each player, when the royal funeral takes place. Will you attend, or make a show of spending your time elsewhere?
