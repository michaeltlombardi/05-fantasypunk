# 6 - core moves

All characters have access to these moves at any time.

## play your role

> Do this to create a collaborative tale without the need for dice or other rules.

When you want to express how your character acts, moves and feels, towards any aspect of the Tale or in response to anyone else's moves, **play your role**.

Describe or roleplay what your character says or does and develop the narrative together with the rest of the Party and the GM.

There is no cost or gain in terms of dice other mechanics, this is a freeform action that includes anything that doesn't present any serious risk, challenge, or chance.

## give it a try

> Do this to decide whether your character is in a position to tro something particularly tricky, risky or uncertain before they make another move.

When you **give something** a try, determine with the Party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true:

- I have a Unique Trait that is especially relevant now;
- I have the time and freedom to go about it without pressure;
- I carry knowledge or tools that are especially relevant now, in the form of Burdens or otherwise.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll, and **play your role** as usual.

If two statements are true, you can **take a chance** with +1d6. If only one statement is true, you can **take a chance** as usual.

If no statements are true, you should consider whether you can try this at all.

## take a chance
> Do this to try somethiung tricky, risky or uncertain, and determine the outcome of your move.

When you **take a chance**, choose an Approach and describe what you hope will happen.

- **critical hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass *and* you may choose one: **take an opportunity** or **avoid a shortcoming**.
- **solid hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass as intended.
- **messy hit**: the outcome you hoped for comes to pass, *but* **take a shortcoming**.
- **miss**: you must **brace yourself**.

## have a say
> Do this to directly influence the narrative as a player rather than through roleplaying your character.

When you want to **have a say** on the Tale to create a new aspect, or elaborate on an existing one, make a Proposal.

Choose one of the options below and describe your Proposal to the other Players.

- create or elaborate on a location;
- create or elaborate on a relationship;
- create or elaborate on an event;
- create or elaborate on a GM character not present or that you're about to meet, and take over that character during this scene.

Take 1d6 from your Personal Pool and go around the group asking each Player if they agree with your Proposal. Anyone who agrees hands over one dice from their pool.

If everyone agrees on the Proposal, it just happens.

If one or more Players did not offer you a die, ask those players “What will happen if I don’t roll a 6?", and they will suggest one or more Alternatives.

Roll the dice you have collected. If you get a 6, the proposal happens. Otherwise, choose one of the Alternatives presented.

Add all of the collected dice to the Party Pool.

## learn about the tale

When you want to **learn more about the Tale**... 

When you want to pull another Player into the Tale to elaborate on an aspect of the Tale, ask them a question about an event, a relationshop, a location or a GM character.

• Is your character telling the truth?
• What’s your character really feeling?
• What does your character intend to do?
• What does your character wish I’d do?
• How could I get your character to —?

• Where’s my best escape route / way in / way past?  
• Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?  
• Which enemy is the biggest threat?  
• What should I be on the lookout for?  
• What’s my enemy’s true position?  
• Who’s in control here?

> When you are able to go to someone for insight, ask them what they think your best course is, and the MC will tell you. If you pursue that course, take +1 to any rolls you make in the pursuit. If you pursue that course but don’t accomplish your ends, you mark experience.

create a new aspect in the Tale, or elaborate on an existing one.

Prompt one of the other Players to add something new to the narrative.

Ask them a question related to people, places, events, or nature, and offer one of your Personal Dice. Any player may take that die and answer the question, adding the new element to the world.

# reaction moves

These moves come into play as a response to other moves.

## take a shortcoming

When you **take a shortcoming**, choose one of the options below, or let an **oracle die** choose for you.

When you **start uneven**, choose an option below before you roll and add +1d6 to the Dice Pool.

1. you make a **mistake**, whether you realize it now or later;
2. you create a **commotion** or attract unwanted attention;
3. you raise **suspicion** or give reason for someone's trust to be shaken;
4. you create a **misunderstanding** or make others doubt your intentions and motives;
5. there is a **delay** as you hesitate, find an obstacle or opposition, or results are not immediate;
6. there is an unforeseen **complication**, unexpected cost or otherwise something that makes things problematic.

## brace yourself

When you must brace yourself, the GM gets to make a move, as hard or dramatic as they see fit.

If you decide you want to avoid it, you can **Push Back**.

## push back

When you want to **push back** against an undesired outcome, tell the party and the GM what part of the tale you want to change.

Discuss with the others how it should happen, then **lessen a Burden**.

# cooperation moves

Use these moves to help or hinder someone else, whether a PC, or a GM character.

## offer help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you share the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## get in the way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

- If they say yes, **heighten a Burden**;
- If they say no, they **heighten a Burden**.

If you give them no choice, make one of your Burdens **too heavy to bear**.

## make a group effort

When multiple PCs **make a group effort**, all Players involved decide what a solid hit, a messy hit and a miss look like.

Each Player involved rolls 1d6 they must take from the Party Pool, then all PCs add the highest 2d6 together.

If there aren't enough Party Dice for all Players involved, any player may **heighten a burden** once to provide a die from their own Personal Pool to another Player.

# party care moves

These moves codify a set of safety tools into the game procedures.

## take a step back

When any Player decides to **take a step back**, stop the game immediately to provide listening and support.

When you need a moment to react to what's happening in the game, tell the other Players you are **taking a step back**.

Inform the rest of the table of your need and engage any tools you need to accommodate them.

## “do we want to?”

When you’re not sure everyone is on board with the chosen course of action you chose, **take a step back** and ask: **"Do we want to?"** to express that you’d like everyone to buy in.

## “Where to next?”

If you feel the adventure came to a standstill or that you are stuck, **take a step back** and ask “Where to next?” to discuss what to do to move the adventure forward.

## “What do you think?”

Sometimes we need a bit of extra time to think, focus or express ourselves. If someone seems quieter or seems to be speaking less, **take a step back** and ask “What do you think?” to check how they are feeling.

## “hold on.”

When you need a break for some water and self-care, or because something happened that is making someone uncomfortable, or because you want to look back at something from earlier, **take a step back** and say “Hold on.”

## “no.”

You shouldn’t do something you don’t want to. If you feel you need to change something to fit your needs or to have agency over your character or the world around you, say “No", then **take a step back**.

## step away

The base assumption is that the game is being productive and that issues and problems can be navigated safely through conversation. If that’s not the case you can leave at any moment.

When any player chooses to step away, **take a step back** to talk about it.
