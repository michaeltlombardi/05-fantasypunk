# common traits

There are 5 Traits: **Kind**, **Brave**, **Curious**, **Cautious**, and **Insightful**.

In broad terms, each Trait represents a form of approaching the world, as well as allowing it to change you.

When making a move, often you'll be prompted to choose an Approach. Decide which Trait best applies, which keyword reflects your intention, and describe what you hope will happen.

# unique trait

Each bearer has a Unique Trait, a simple word of phrase that sets them further apart from the other characters.

When a Bearer is **taking a chance**, they may describe whether their own Unique Trait may influence their words or deeds.
