# **attribution**

fantasypunk started out as a hack of dungeonpunk, by Ash McAllan, one of the coolest approaches to minimal fantasy games Powered by the Apocalypse I had seen.

It's now become something else as it's grown in a very different direction from Ash's **dungeonpunk**, focusing on what being an adventurer means.
