## Debts

A form of bond with an entity that must be repaid somehow. When a debt grows too large, that entity will find a way to collect.

## Obligations

Promises, duties or quests you must fulfil for a variety of reasons, from avoiding or clearing debts, to earning a break or gaining someone’s favour.

## Origin

The life you had before you ended up as an adventurer. The GM will rely on your origin to fill the world with relevant details, and you can leverage your Origin to have the GM give you valuable information.

## Heritage

Abilities and gifts from your blood or history. Heritage allows you to explore the world in unique ways, even being able to make moves at time you otherwise wouldn’t. Sometimes your Heritage can help or hinder you more directly.
