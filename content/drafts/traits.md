Consensus Dice

At the start of every session, everyone gets a pool of 6-sided dice equal to the number of players. This is their Personal Pool.

> If there are 4 players, everyone gets 4 dice.

When a player proposes a course of action that would necessitate a roll, they describe the outcome that they want. This is called the Proposal.

Then, they take one of the dice from their pool and hold it in their hand. Then, they go in order, asking everyone if they agree on the Proposal. Anyone who agrees hands over one dice from their pool.

If everyone agrees on the Proposal then the player does not roll. The Proposal just happens.

The player puts all the collected dice (including the one they contributed) in the center of the table in the Community Pool.

Otherwise, if the player did not receive a dice from everyone, they must roll the dice that they did get to discover what happens. 

They ask “What will happen if I don’t roll a 6?” This is called the Counter. Players who did not give dice get final say on this. 

Then, the player rolls the dice that they have collected. If they get a 6, the Proposal happens. If they don’t roll a 6, the Counter is what is accepted into the fiction. 

Once a player’s Personal Pool is empty, they can refresh fully from the Community Pool. 

> Raj and 3 friends are playing. Raj’s character is picking a lock to a room where a friend is captured. Raj proposes that he picks the lock and frees his friend. 
> 
> He asks for consensus in order. 2 friends agree and hand over dice. But the 3rd friend disagrees and counters by saying that the room should turn out to be empty. 
> 
> Since there’s no consensus, Raj must roll. He has 3 dice. One from his pool and 2 from his friends. 
> 
> He rolls and does not get a 6. He picks the lock and breaks into the room and finds it empty!
