# pillars: collaborative common ground

The tenets of **fantasypunk** in Pillars, Agenda and Principles.

## pillars

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around you;
- People are complicated, diverse, and often conflicted but are mostly kind and willing to do good;
- Most people, including you, are fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- Deities are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals whether they exist at all;
- No individuals, communities or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency.
