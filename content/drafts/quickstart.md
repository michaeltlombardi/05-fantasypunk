Quick start rules

# The Setup

**fantasypunk** is a roleplaying game about wanderers, travellers, the found and the lost, the seekers and the runaways.

Gather a group of 4 to 6 players, including you. You can stray from that range, but do it at your own risk.

Choose one of you to play as the Giramundo, or GM, while the others play as Party Companions, or PCs.

The GM is the only player who needs to know this game better. The others can just follow the GM's lead.

You will need at least one six-sided die (d6), writing materials, and the basic rules for this game as a reference. 

Schedule about 2 or 3 hours to play together, plus a bit of extra time to talk about how you wish to play the game, to have breaks when necessary, and to talk about the game after you finish.

Find or create a safe, welcoming, comfortable space where everyone can have enough freedom, intimacy, and support as possible to express yourselves.

Agree on what safety tools you wish to employ to help you all navigate tricky or uncomfortable situations that may emerge from play.

# How to Play

**Follow these steps to prepare the game:**

1. Take turns reading the player principles;
2. Choose an existing setting or create one together or roll 1d6 on the table below:

# The Pillars of Play

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around the you;
- Folk are complicated, conflicted and diverse, but are mostly kind and willing to help;
- Most people, including you, is fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- The gods are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals;
- No individuals, folk or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency.

## Agenda

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## Principles

- Be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions. Always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

# Scenarios and Settings

Decide on a setting or scenario you all would like to explore.

You can use a world from a popular movie or book, choose a setting written for games like this, or come up with your own. Maybe all of those together, and if you want, the whole group can participate in coming up with a world that is interesting, mysterious, and full of opportunities.

Alternatively, you can use the micro-settings and scenarios described below. Choose one of them or roll 1d6 to let the die choose for you.

1. **Sol** - The world is incredibly old, and civilizations rose and fell so many times few dare keep track. The Old World left Relics powered by the Sun, which no one can recreate and few can figure out what they are for, often settling on repurposing them. Sol is a Post-Fantasy setting of high magic and mystical technology both ubiquitous and mysterious;

2. **Many Moons** - It is said that less than a century ago, the Last Day set, the sky lit up with crimson and gold, the stars burned and then many Moons rose from the core of the planet to light the path to freedom. They criss-cross the sky, bathing us with eternal twilight, ever-shifting the Tides, which we learned to Sail to build our lives within the crystal domes that now bejewel the world.

3. **We, the Monsters** - When the Spheres converged, Humans poured into our world, hell-bent on conquering, colonizing, and annihilating everything they didn't own or understand. They call our homes lairs, our communities hordes, and us they call monsters. They have destroyed or stolen too much, yet it is not enough. But we, the Monsters, will hold our ground and push back, and they will be sorry they ever set foot in our world.

4. **Everything is Good** - There is a village between the River and the Mountain, embraced by the Woods. In this quiet, peaceful village, the Elders keep the Community organized, while the folk toil and idle happily. Every day is the same, everyone is content and everything is in place. And it's all wrong. All of you are blow-ins, but none of you remember where you arrived from, who you were before or why you are here. And this realization hits you like a hammer as all of you wake up somewhere deep in the woods, by a white obelisk, and there are a bunch of dead people lying around you.

5. **Stonetouched** - When the children of Lua come of age, they gather around the Stones, a set of rocks that sprout from the ground in a semi-circular formation. They sing and dance, and the stones hum in harmony with their chant. During the ritual, each youth vibes with one of the Stones, receiving one of the aspects of the moonfolk: 
    - From the Black Stone, the form of the Moon, Enluara. 
    - From the Myriad stone, the form of the Dream, Quimera. 
    - From the Coral Stone,the form of the Fire, Valente. 
    - From the Nightstone, the form of the Star, Celeste. 
    - From the Clearstone, the form of the Light, Lumiar. 
    
    Usually, three to five youths participate in the ceremony together. Once they receive their blessings, they are to be sent out in the world as a party and journey through it to become wiser.

6. **A Rock and a Hard Place** - A Runaway Princess, a Stargazer, a Knight of the Moon and Star, and a Petty Criminal find themselves beset by a band of mercenaries led by The Hound on one flank, while the gates of the Devil's Keep looms on the other. This day started badly when you lost the ship to sail past the Misty Sea towards the Rou homeland, and now this. How did you end up in this situation, and, more importantly, how will you get the heck out of it?

# 3. Introduce the Cast

Follow these steps to create your PC. You can skip any step if you feel stuck and come back to them later as you get more ideas from the other players and from the things you come up with.

1. To create a PC, choose their name, determine their pronouns, and choose a Background.
2. Each character has 5 Traits: Kind, Brave, Curious, Cautious, and Insightful. Choose one of those to be Striving, and another to be Struggling.
3. Choose a unique trait from their Background.
4. Each PC carries some Baggage, 5 items that represent their most relevant possessions, skills, abilities, or lessons learned. Take the items offered from your Background and interpret them however it makes sense for your character.
5. Choose 1 Special Move to complete your character.
6. Circle back to revise the character you put together and change anything you need as appropriate.

Most moves require that you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Cautious, or Insightful.

When you make a move, describe what you are doing and how, and figure which Trait best applies to your approach.

# Challenges

Sometimes a complication escalates beyond a simple approach, or at other times, things start hot right out of the gate. That's when the PCs may face a Challenge.

## Creating a Challenge

To create a Challenge, name it after what the PCs are trying to move towards (Escape Captivity, Find the Secret Entrance to the Keep, Meet with the Baroness), or what is antagonizing them (Greedy Dragon, Angry Mob, Doctor Desmond, The Guardian Magic).

Then write in two to five Aspects. Aspects represent how Challenges defy the PCs, and what specific obstacles they must engage in to overcome the Challenge.

Aspects should be concise, no longer than two or three words.

When the GM must make a move in reaction to the PCs on the behalf of a Challenge, usually it's by describing it as an Aspect expressing itself.
    

## Overcoming Challenges

Overcoming a Challenge doesn't mean necessarily overcoming each and all of its Angles, as the fiction changes every time the party overcomes an Angle.

Some Challenges might be overcome by defeating only some of its Angles.

Maybe by pursuing complete defeat of the Challenge, the party might earn a greater benefit, while the overall cost is very likely to be higher as a downside.

---

# The Giramundo

As the GM, you are a kind of host, facilitator, and counterpoint to the other Players. Your main job is to help provoke dramatic situations for the PCs and be able to introduce others to the rules. 

It’s okay to learn as you go, too. The core of the game is mostly in the basic and special moves.

## Agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- Play to find out what happens;
- Sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- Make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

## Always say

- What the principles demand (as follow);
- What the rules demand;
- What your prep demands;
- What honesty demands.

## Principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- Talk to the Characters, not the Players;
- Change the World;
- Change the Characters;
- Favour Opportunities over Outcomes;
- Embrace the fantastic;
- Leave Blank Spaces;
- Be a Fan of the Players AND the Characters.

## GM Moves

- Make Their Baggage Heavier;
- Give Them a Choice;
- Plant a Seed;
- Take Something Away;
- Show How the Community Feels;
- Ask a Question;
- Random Encounter;
- Give Them What They Want;
- Say “But...”.

# The First Scene

Once all of the PCs are ready, it's time for the GM to introduce them to the first scene.

From here on, the PCs don't need to continue reading. We assume that the player who takes the role of the GM is reading this.

Start by coming up with an interesting situation that immediately places the PCs front and center.

Maybe they are taking part in a chase, front, back, or both! Alternatively, they could have been cornered by someone, literally or not.

Some of the most engaging charged situations involve one or more of the PCs personally and intimately - a close friend in trouble, a request by an ally, a personal enemy facing them, and so on. The more PCs get wrapped up from the beginning, the better.
