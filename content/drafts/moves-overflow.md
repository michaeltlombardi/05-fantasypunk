# moves overflow

### Recall a Flashback

When you recall a Flashback, you invoke a past action or situation to conveniently produce a resource, material, or otherwise, to advance the tale.

- spend 1 Flashback token to invoke an action or a situation that you ordinarily would have access to or an opportunity for;
- spend 2 Flashback tokens to invoke a more complex action or situation that probably required some preparation, a unique opportunity, or being in the right place at the rightr time.

After you spend your tokens and frame the scene, choose the appropriate Approach move and roll the dice.

On any result, hit or miss, you get what you wanted. You still must account for any Shortcomings or Brace Yourself on a miss.

When you want to **learn more about the Tale**... 

When you want to pull another Player into the Tale to elaborate on an aspect of the Tale, ask them a question about an event, a relationshop, a location or a GM character.

• Is your character telling the truth?
• What’s your character really feeling?
• What does your character intend to do?
• What does your character wish I’d do?
• How could I get your character to —?

• Where’s my best escape route / way in / way past?  
• Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?  
• Which enemy is the biggest threat?  
• What should I be on the lookout for?  
• What’s my enemy’s true position?  
• Who’s in control here?

When you are able to go to someone for insight, ask them what they think your best course is, and the MC will tell you. If you pursue that course, take +1 to any rolls you make in the pursuit. If you pursue that course but don’t accomplish your ends, you mark experience.

create a new aspect in the Tale, or elaborate on an existing one.

Prompt one of the other Players to add something new to the narrative.

Ask them a question related to people, places, events, or nature, and offer one of your Personal Dice. Any player may take that die and answer the question, adding the new element to the world.
