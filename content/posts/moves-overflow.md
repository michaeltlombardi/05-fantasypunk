# moves overflow

### Recall a Flashback

When you recall a Flashback, you invoke a past action or situation to conveniently produce a resource, material, or otherwise, to advance the tale.

- spend 1 Flashback token to invoke an action or a situation that you ordinarily would have access to or an opportunity for;
- spend 2 Flashback tokens to invoke a more complex action or situation that probably required some preparation, a unique opportunity, or being in the right place at the rightr time.

After you spend your tokens and frame the scene, choose the appropriate Approach move and roll the dice.

On any result, hit or miss, you get what you wanted. You still must account for any Shortcomings or Brace Yourself on a miss.
