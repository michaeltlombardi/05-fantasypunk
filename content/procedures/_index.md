_There is a crack in everything. That is how the light gets in._ - Leonard Cohen

Heroes are often thought of as paragons of strength, wisdom, or virtue who always seem to figure out what to do, or always get the specific help they need when they get stuck. They seem to never face hopelessness or loss for too long, or only for long enough to turn those into yet another form of power.

So they stride across the land, stomping over every challenge in their path, destroying everything that opposes them, and disregarding all folk, magic, or nature that happen to be in their way.

The tales told here are not about them.

The tales told here are about much more fallible people. Complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people. The people who create problems and who solve problems, and how often both are the same people.

No one can guarantee that the rough-edged and jaded stories told here won't be, in time, worn down by the tongues of storytellers into shapes perfectly smooth, rounded, and solid.

But until then, let's look at what burdens that complex, troubled, wondrous, and broken people accumulate, and how they crack under their weight.
