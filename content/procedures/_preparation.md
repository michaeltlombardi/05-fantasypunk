# It's dangerous out there: take these

- a player to be the Giramundo, or GM, a kind of host and guide for the game;
- a group of 3 to 5 players to be the Party Companions, or PCs. You can stray from that range, but I can't promise it will work as well;
- at least one six-sided die (d6), although at 5 or 6 of them is better;
- writing materials, analog or digital, whatever;
- and the basic rules for this game as a reference
- about 3 or 4 hours to play together: have breaks when necessary;
- a safe, welcoming, comfortable environment to play, phisically or online;
- an agreement on safty tools, tone and and expectations for each session you play.
