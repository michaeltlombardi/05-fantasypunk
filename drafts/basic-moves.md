# concept 1

When you make a move, you express *intentions*.

The point is that you go for an action and that action caries an intent.

Sttronger hits allow your intention and action too go in tandem.

But weaker hits offer you a bargan between success and completeness, orr speed etc, or your intention not being misread, misjudged misplaced etc, bring you more trouble.

Options for working the concept later:

- you raise suspicion
- you ttract unwanted attention
- you place someone in harm's way
- you place someone in trouble
- you reveal yourself
- your intentions are not what they seem
- you betray a sort of "selfish" interest

### Be Kind

**When you are kind**, ask the GM or another player what their character, a place or another entity needs. Describe how you intend to fulfil that need, then roll Kind.

On a critical hit, choose none. On a solid hit choose one. On a messy hit, choose 2.

- results: they comes as a cost, are incomplete or faulty, or you get the barest clue about how to move forward;
- actions: your actions are offensive to a culture, custom, rules or laws, if not outright harmful;
- intentions: someone beccomes suspicious or distrustful of you, or will not cooperate without a show of good faith;

Results, Actions, Intentions.
- heal, treat, aid;
- relate, empathize, inspire, support;
- sway, disarm, placate.

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

### REWRITE

Back to this one, there is something interesting here. 

on any hit, you do the thing. 

On a strong hit choose a question from the good list, on a weak hit, chose a question from both good and ba lists. 

you can add 1d6 to your roll by every question from the bad list you answer before you roll

### GOOD
- benefits to others
- someone likes what you do idk
- you get it all

### BAD
- you harm someone
- you make someone's life harder or worse
- you don't get it all



- your actions bring an unforeseen benefit to others;
- your 


- how can this benefit others? 
- what did you hope to accomplish or get across?
- how did you take others in consideration when you chose your course of actions?

- how can this cause trouble or make life difficult to others? 
- what did you not consider could harm others?
- how did it fall short, fall through or made it less accesibe  to others?

I could add a line to have the PC let others pick the answers because that cold allow pcs to resolve the move faster by delegating or outsourcing especially when they are in a rut
