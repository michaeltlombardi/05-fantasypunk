# 4 - the cast: player characters

The Party Companions in **fantasypunk** are magical and mundane at the same time.

## Gather Your Party & Venture Forth

The party is a home away from home. A kind of found family that tags along for better or for worse, by choice or out of need, all cozy and nice or bickering endlessly.

To create a Party Companion, each player must follow the steps below, not necessarily in the order presented.

It's strongly encouraged that all of you create your PCs together to bounce ideas off of each other.

1. Start with a name and pronouns
2. Each character has 5 Traits: Kind, Brave, Curious, Cautious, and Insightful. Tag one of those as Striving, and another as Struggling.
3. Pick a Background;
4. Take 5 Burdens: your background offers a few Burdens and a few prompts to create the rest;
5. Choose 2 Special Moves to complete your character;
6. Revise your choices and talk about them with the other players. Change anything you need.
