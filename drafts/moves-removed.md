When your character grows, you have the option of picking more of these moves and features.

# Bonding

Moves and features from this list emphasize connections care.

## Moves

### Make Friends

When you **make a new friend**, roll Kind.

On a sound hit, choose 2 traits they are and 1 trait they are not. On a messy hit, choose 1 trait they are and 1 trait they are not. On a miss, choose a trait they are and 2 traits they are not.

Traits: Kind, Generous, Knowledgeable, Wise, Helpful, Resourceful, Forgiving, Connected, Honest, something else.

Give them two desires from the Elements where you meet them for the first time.

### Read a Person

When you read a person, roll Kind.

On a sound hit, you get 3 tokens. On a messy hit, you get 1 token.

During your interaction, spend your tokens 1 for 1 to ask the GM or their player questions. They have to answer frankly, from their character’s point of view.

- Are you telling the truth?
- What are you feeling?
- What are you thinking of doing?
- What do you hope I’ll do?
- How could I get you to do [x]?

On a miss, brace yourself.

### Persuade

When you persuade someone, say what you want them to do (or not do).

**For the party:** When you persuade a party member and they resist, ask them: "Could I possibly get you to do this, yes or no?" If the answer is "No," let it drop. If the answer is "Yes," you can roll Kind.

On a sound hit, they mark XP if they do what you want, and if they don't, they must reveal how you could convince them. On a messy hit, they mark XP if they do what you want (but can refuse or make a counter-offer if they like).

**For the other folk:** If they have reason to resist, roll Kind: on a sound hit, they either do as you want or reveal the easiest way to convince them. On a messy hit, they reveal something you can do to convince them, though it’ll likely be costly, tricky, or distasteful.

### Confidante

When a party member seeks your advice, tell them what you think the best course of action is. If they go along, they choose one:

- They roll +1d6 for as long as they follow that course of action;
- They get 1 XP;

## Features

### Giving

Once per session, gain 1 XP if you've helped someone at a personal cost.

# Conflict

Moves and features in this list emphasise the tools that emerge from resistance and struggle.

## Moves

### Confront a Foe

When you confront a foe with words or arms, be Brave.

On a solid hit, you get 4 tokens against your foe. On a messy hit, you get 3 tokens against them. On a miss, you get 1 token against them. 

Your foe gets 2 tokens against you on any hit, and 3 tokens against you on a miss.

To conduct the battle, spend your tokens on the following. Commit to your spending without knowing your foe’s.

- Out to get them: Spend 1 token to inflict a lesser blow (you can pick this more than once to improve the blow to mean then to hard);
- Defensive stance: Spend 1 token to save 1 Hold (you can pick this more than once);
- Fight dirty: Spend 1 token to inflict a lesser blow to an additional enemy (you can pick this more than once);

- Seize initiative: Whoever spends more tokens to seize the initiative, does.

If you seize the initiative, you get one of these, as applicable. On a critical hit, you can get both, if applicable.

- Ask 1 Read the Room question for free, with no roll;

- You don't make too much noise;
- You don't take a long time.

On a miss, brace yourself.

### Heavy Words

When you threaten or intimidate someone, name your demands and state what will happen if they're not met, then be Brave.

On a sound hit: They will try to meet your demands as best they can. On a messy hit: They will try to follow your demands as long as the threat is real and present. On a miss, brace yourself.

### Slay

When you take decisive and direct action to put an opponent down with words or deeds, erase a burden and instantly kill them or shut them down.

### Against the odds:

When you’re backed in a corner, be Brave. On a sound hit, choose 1:

- You have an unexpected ally. Ask the GM who it is.
- You have a desperate opportunity. Ask the GM what it is.
- You have a sudden realization. Ask or tell the GM what it is.
- You find reserves of speed, strength, or endurance. Tell the GM what you can do.
- You have a piece of amazing luck. Ask or tell the GM what it is.

On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 for you. On a miss, you are good and cornered. Brace yourself.

## Features

### Valour

Once per session, gain 1 XP when you defeat a worthy foe.

# Wonder

Moves from this list emphasise the connection with powers beyond our own through observation and perception.

## Moves

### Invoke the Old Powers

When you invoke the Old Powers, consider what is the effect you desire and ask the table what price is to be paid for invoking such powers, then roll Insightful.

On a sound hit, you get 2 tokens. On a messy hit, you get 1. Spend tokens, one for one, on the following options:

- the effect you desire comes to pass;
- you retain control;
- you avoid paying nature’s price.

### Interpret Patterns

When you carefully observe the patterns of life, like the whispers of a stream, the way a spider weaves its web, the endless horizon or the coffee at the bottom of a mug, roll Insightful. 

On any hit, the GM tells you something new and interesting about the present or the foreseeable future, and might ask you a question or two; answer them.

On a solid hit, the GM gives you good detail. On a messy hit, the GM gives you an impression. If you already know all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.

### Shape Change

**Scatter track: ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐**

You can transform into an animal that you have studied extensively, and back again. While in this form, your inventory is a list of that animal's natural features.

Choose two tags for that animal, replacing your own personal tags while you're in its shape.

Scatter: When you spend long periods of time in animal shape, or when you endure stress, exhaustion or harm, you start to forget how much of you is you and how much of you is the animal, until you forget completely.

- Gain 1 scatter when you spend a whole shift in animal form;
- Gain 1 scatter when you take a serious Blow;
- Gain 1 scatter when you lose all Hold on a burden;
- Gain 1 scatter when you erase a burden.

At 3 scatter you need help to regain your true form. At 5 scatter you become an animal and even if you are turned back by someone powerful enough to revert your condition, it changes you. Erase one of your personal tags and replace it with another.

### Summon Elements

You can summon a fistful of an element of nature nearby to your control, such as fire, earth, air, light, air, ice, and so on. You can hold on to it for as long as you concentrate and you can shape it as you wish.

### Wondrous Healer

When you treat someone to heal their wounds, pains and afflictions, roll Insightful. Tell the table what herbs, rituals and you require to work your magic.

On a critical hit, you get 3 tokens. On a sound hit, you get 2. On a messy hit, you get 1.

Spend your tokens 1 for 1 on the options below:

- They recover 1 Hold (you can pick this multiple times);
- They regain consciousness;
- They revert back from a transformation;
- You soothe their pain, at least temporarily;
- You treat their curse or otherwise mystical affliction
- Take +1d6 the next time you continue this treatment.

Some wounds or affliction may take a long time to heal, or more specific materials, a specific location and so on. The GM will tell you when that's the case or ask the table about it.

On a miss, brace yourself.

### Chanter's Lore

You can comprehend the mystic languages of magic, at least to a point. Tell the rest of the table what these languages are like, whether they are verbal, how they are taught, and what it is like to others to witness someone reading them.

When you read arcane texts, scrolls, or spellbooks, roll Insightful.

On a solid hit, you summon the magic on the page into being. On a messy hit, you summon the magic on the page into being, erasing its contents in the process. On a miss, brace yourself for magic going awry.

### Stealth

When you avoid mundane scrutiny, roll Precise.

On a hit, you start a clock. You may remain unnoticed until you tick all of the sections of that clock. On a critical hit, you start a 6 clock. On a sound hit, you start a 4 clock. On a messy hit, you start a 4 clock and must pick one of these options:

- You use your party as a distraction and remain free to move and act unnoticed;
- You may act and remain unnoticed only as long as you stay where you are;
- You can move unnoticed only as long as you do nothing;
- The clock is hidden from you.

You can clear two segments of the clock by picking a new option from above.

You can tick more segments of the clock to gain certain benefits:

- 2 ticks to aggravate a blow you inflict;
- 1 tick to give +1d6 to a party member;
- 2 ticks to add +1 to your initiative (when using the Confront a Foe move);
- 2 ticks to give yourself +1d6;
- 5 ticks to use the slay move, even if you don't have it;
