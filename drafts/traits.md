# core moves

All characters have access to these moves at any time.

## play your role

At any time, roleplay your PC's actions, reactions, and emotions in response to any of the other types of actions, or to propel the story forwards in some way. 

There is no cost or gain in terms of dice other mechanics, this is a freeform action that includes anything that doesn't present any serious risk, challenge, or chance.

## give it a try

When you **give things a try** or take a chance, determine with the Party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true:

> - I have a Unique Trait that is especially relevant now;
> - I have the time and freedom to go about it without pressure;
> - I carry knowledge or tools that are especially relevant now, in the form of Burdens or otherwise.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll.

Otherwise, choose an Approach and describe what you hope will happen.

- When two statements are true, take +1d6, and roll the dice.
- When one statement is true, roll the dice as usual.

On a **critical hit**, the outcome you hoped for comes to pass *and* you may choose one: **take an opportunity or avoid a shortcoming**.

On a **solid hit**, the outcome you hoped for comes to pass more or less as intended.

On a **messy hit**, the outcome you hoped for comes to pass, *but* take a **shortcoming**.

On a **miss** you must **brace yourself**.

## pull a thread

ask a question about people, places, community, or events heighten weight to add to the token pool

## propose something new

create a new truth about people, places, nature, or events, spend from the token pool

propose a truth and do procedure below

on a non-consensus, propose alternative or different ditails etc then roll

When you propose something new to the narrative, such as a new piece of lore, an event going on in the background, a new character and their goings, a new element in the scene, and so on, take 1d6 from your Personal Pool.

Asking the other Players in order if they agree on your proposal. Anyone who agrees hands over one dice from their pool.

If everyone agrees on the Proposal, it just happens. Add all of the collected dice to the Community Pool.

If you did not receive a dice from everyone else, ask “What will happen if I don’t roll a 6?" Players who did not give dice suggest an Alternative.

Roll he dice you have collected. If you get a 6, the proposal happens. Otherwise, the Alternative takes place.

Consensus Dice

At the start of every session, everyone gets a pool of 6-sided dice equal to the number of players. This is their Personal Pool.

> If there are 4 players, everyone gets 4 dice.

When a player proposes a course of action that would necessitate a roll, they describe the outcome that they want. This is called the Proposal.

Then, they take one of the dice from their pool and hold it in their hand. Then, they go in order, asking everyone if they agree on the Proposal. Anyone who agrees hands over one dice from their pool.

If everyone agrees on the Proposal then the player does not roll. The Proposal just happens.

The player puts all the collected dice (including the one they contributed) in the center of the table in the Community Pool.

Otherwise, if the player did not receive a dice from everyone, they must roll the dice that they did get to discover what happens. 

They ask “What will happen if I don’t roll a 6?” This is called the Counter. Players who did not give dice get final say on this. 

Then, the player rolls the dice that they have collected. If they get a 6, the Proposal happens. If they don’t roll a 6, the Counter is what is accepted into the fiction. 

Once a player’s Personal Pool is empty, they can refresh fully from the Community Pool. 

> Raj and 3 friends are playing. Raj’s character is picking a lock to a room where a friend is captured. Raj proposes that he picks the lock and frees his friend. 
> 
> He asks for consensus in order. 2 friends agree and hand over dice. But the 3rd friend disagrees and counters by saying that the room should turn out to be empty. 
> 
> Since there’s no consensus, Raj must roll. He has 3 dice. One from his pool and 2 from his friends. 
> 
> He rolls and does not get a 6. He picks the lock and breaks into the room and finds it empty!
